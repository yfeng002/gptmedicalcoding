This is an ___ year old woman with PMH of CKD, IDDM2, CAD (RCA 
stent ___ but normal MIBI in ___, PVD, s/p L fem-distal? 
bypass, asymptomatic meningioma who presents with L wrist pain, 
found to have positive troponins in the setting of intermittent 
chest pain for the past several months, with new T-wave 
inversions on EKG.

ACUTE ISSUES
===================
#NSTEMI
#CAD
Ms. ___ reported intermittent chest pain and had an EKG with 
new T wave inversions She was found to have troponin elevation 
to 0.1 and she had a pharmacologic nuclear stress test which 
showed a reversible perfusion defect. She was admitted to the 
cardiology service. Overnight, she had chest pain and new ST 
depressions in V2-V5, and was started on a heparin drip. Her 
troponins were elevated to 0.58. She had a left heart 
catheterization which revealed 3VD with no obvious culprit 
lesion and non-obstructive disease. Throughout her admission, 
she was continued on her home aspirin, carvedilol, rosuvastatin, 
isosorbide, ranolazine, and Plavix for medical therapy of CAD. 
Her hydralizine was titrated up as needed. Her NSTEMI was 
thought to be demand ischemia in the setting of hypertension.

#Acute Inflammatory Arthritis
Ms. ___ presented primarily for left wrist pain. 
Arthrocentesis in the emergency department showed 4+ PMNs, serum 
uric acid as 7.2. There was not enough fluid for crystal 
studies. Joint fluid culture remained negative. Blood cultures 
showed GPCs in pairs and chains, and in this setting, she was 
started on vancomycin for concern for septic arthritis. 
Differential diagnosis also included gout and pseudogout. Her 
pain was managed with tylenol, ice, and a lidocaine patch. 
Repeat US guided fluid aspiration and lavage was attempted, but 
there was not enough fluid to send for studies. She was 
discharged on IV ceftriaxone 2g q24h to continue for 4 weeks.

#Bacteremia: On presentation, Ms. ___ had blood cultures 
drawn, which showed GPCs in pairs and chains. She was initiated 
on vancomycin appropriate for her renal function, which she was 
maintained on while sensitives were pending. TTE ws without 
vegetation. She had a PICC line placed and was discharged on IV 
ceftriaxone as described above.

#HTN: Her hydralizine was titrated up to control her blood 
pressure in the setting of Type II NSTEMI.

#HFpEF: LFEV 57%: Her volume status was evaluated daily. Her 
torsemide was held in the setting of her LHC. She was not 
initiated on spironolactone due to her frequent hyperkalemia, 
which was not an issue during this hospitalization.

SUMMARY
This is a ___ year old female with past medical history of type 2 
diabetes, bipolar disorder, admitted ___ w right hand 
cellulitis at site of recent cat bite, initially failing PO 
doxycycline and metronidazole, started on IV broad spectrum 
antibiotics and seen by ID and hand consult services, with 
subsequent significant improvement, discharged home on oral 
antibiotics for total 7 days 

#) Severe Left Hand Cellulitis / Cat Bite: Patient presented in 
setting of recent cat bite with progressive erythema at bite 
site; did not improve with outpatient PO regimen of doxycycline 
and metronidazole.  No evidence of abscess on exam. Antibiotic 
coverage was provided for typical cellulitis organisms (MRSA, 
Streptococcus) and cat-bite related organisms (Pasteurella, 
anaerobes). Of note, patient reported a penicillin allergy but 
tolerated ceftriaxone received in the ED. In ED she was switched 
from PO doxycycline and metronidazole to IV metronidazole, IV 
ceftriaxone, and IV vancomycin. Hand surgery saw the patient and 
recommended no intervention. Infectious Disease consultants 
recommended switching to PO doxycycline and moxifloxacin with 
treatment to be completed on ___. Unfortunately moxifloxacin 
not covered by insurance and patient was discharged on 
levofloxacin, flagyl, and doxycycline. The patient did not have 
a leukocytosis or systemic symptoms. At time of discharge, exam 
showed resolution of erythema over dorsum of R hand, minimal 
tenderness at bite site, which was clean dry and intact and 
without underlying bogginess / fluctuance. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
#) Migraines: patient reported these had been well controlled 
recently. Home fioricet and topiramate were continued while 
inpatient. 
#) Bipolar Disorder: patient appeared euthymic throughout 
hospitalization. Home lamotrigine and lurasidone were continued.
#) Xerosis: patient reported this was unconcerning. Mupirocin 
ointment was given as needed.
#) Dry Eyes: patient reports this has been unconcerning. Home 
cyclosporine ophthalmic and olapatadine were held as they were 
non-formulary. Artifical eye drops were given as needed.
#) GERD: Home ranitidine was continued
#) Asthma: patient reports this had been well controlled at time 
of admission. Home montelukast/ipratropium/cetirizine, albuterol 
were continued while hospitalized.

balloon angioplasty and non-ST elevation MI ___, T2DM, HTN, 
HLD presents after having presyncopal episode in a bus on his 
way to a routine primary care appointment, found to be in atrial 
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and rising 
troponins and CKMB concerning for NSTEMI vs demand ischemia ___CTIVE ISSUES
=============
# Presyncopal episode/altered mental status: Patient reported 
feeling lightheaded, dizzy and clammy while on a bus. The bus 
was stopped and EMS found him to be hypotensive with SBP ___ and 
in new onset Afib with RVR. He was taken to the ED for further 
management where a ___ did not reveal acute intracranial 
hemorrhage, but new onset a fib with RVR was confirmed. He was 
admitted to cardiology service for further evaluation (as 
below). 

# Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient was found to be in 
atrial fibrillation with rates elevated to 150s-160s. An initial 
EKG had a possible 1mm STD in V4-V6, although he had no chest 
pain. Trop was 02 on admission and gradually peaked at 0.37 
while CKMB peaked at 22 before both downtrended. He never 
endorsed any chest pain. Although not completely certain whether 
the clinical picture and labs represented a primary NSTEMI with 
subsequent atrial fibrillation or new onset atrial fibrillation 
with RVR leading to demand ischemia, eventually it was thought 
that the later was the more likely cause. His rates remained 
difficult to control with HR 150s-160s despite metoprolol 
tartrate 75 mg PO q6h. He was switched to diltiazem 60 mg QID 
and subsequently required a dilt gtt. He received successful 
TEE/DCCV on ___ with return to normal sinus rhythm. Given CHADS 
score of 3 and CHADSVasc2 of 5, he was started on Xarelto 20 mg 
daily for oral anticoagulation. He was continued on home 
metoprolol at discharge for rate control. 

# Acute kidney injury: Patient with creatinine elevation to 1.6 
on admission (baseline 1.1-1.2 but more recently higher). 
Etiology believed to be pre-renal in setting of demand ischemia 
versus atrial fibrillation. Improved to 1.2 on discharge. Home 
losartan was briefly held but restarted at discharge. 

# CAD: Significant ischemic history. He had elevated troponins 
that peaked at 0.37 with MB 22, thought to be more likely 
consistent with demand ischemia in the setting of atrial 
fibrillation. Plan was to defer ischemia workup with PMIBI to 
his outpatient cardiologist. He was continued on ASA 81 mg, 
simvastatin 20 mg daily, and home metoprolol at discharge. 

CHRONIC ISSUES
==============
# Hypertension: stable. Home losartan was briefly held in the 
setting of acute kidney injury but restarted at home dose at 
discharge. He was continued on home metoprolol succinate 100 mg 
BID. 

# Diabetes: Metformin was held while in-house and he was placed 
on insulin SSI. 

# Peripheral Vascular Disease: He was continued on home aspirin 
and cilostazol. 

# GERD: Stable. Continued on home ranitidine.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=====================
# For anticoagulation, the patient was initiated on Xarelto 20 
mg. If creatinine clearance drops below 50, would need to 
decrease Xarelto to 15 mg daily. Could consider discontinuing 
aspirin.
# For AV nodal blockade, the patient was discharged on home 
metoprolol succinate XL 100 mg BID.
# Home losartan was initially held but restarted prior to 
discharge. 
# Patient will need PMIBI as an outpatient for further 
evaluation of possible ischemia. 
# Patient will need ___ of Hearts monitor as outpatient for ___ 
weeks, though this was unable to be set up as inpatient given 
lack of monitors available.

___ year old female with PMHx of stroke, CAD, HTN, DM, dCHF, and 
recent severe eczema over face with possible superinfection who 
presented with syncope in setting of Eczematous dermatitis, 
later found to be ___ scabies, with likely NSTEMI/demand 
ischemia secondary to decreased PO intake, dehydration, 
infection; hospital course was complicated by lacunar infarct, 
atrial fibrillation with hypotension necessatating ICU transfer 
for rate control, as well as acute systolic heart failure. 

# Syncope: Patient presented with a presyncopal/syncopal event 
in the setting of 3 days of poor PO intake while on antibiotics 
for a skin rash (see below). The was treated with IVF and 
encouragement of PO intake. 

# Demand ischemia: During her work-up for syncope, the patient 
was found to have troponin elevation to 0.18, which then trended 
downward. This was thought to be secondary to demand ischemia in 
the setting of her syncopal event. She was continued on her home 
aspirin, plavix, beta blocker. Patient was not on a statin due 
to allergy. 
 
# ___ scabies: Pt previously treated for presumed 
eczematous dermatitis with PO and topical steroids and PO and IV 
abx. She was seen by Dermatology and found to have ___ 
scabies. She was treated with permethrin and ivernectin multiple 
times during her admission as well as triamcinolone cream with 
significant improvement in her rash. 

# Lacunar stroke: Patient experienced sudden onset of right hand 
weakness and L facial droop during her stay. CT and MR were 
negative for acute process, but it was presumed that she had 
incurred a lacunar infarct due to drop in systolic pressure 
during her episode of atrial fibrillation with hypotension (see 
below). Anti-hypertensives were held and right hand weakness 
subsequently improved with the aid of ___.

# CHF: During the patient's admission, a TTE was done to further 
evaluate the patient's cardiac function. TTE showed an EF of 15% 
with global systolic ventricular dysfunction (EF of 55-60% in 
___. Uncertain etiology but likely ischemic. She had mild-mod 
pulmonary edema on CXR and increased O2 requirement, but no 
increase in peripheral edema or JVD. She was diuresed carefully, 
as her pressures were soft. 

# Afib with hypotension: Patient was transferred to the CCU in 
the setting of afib with RVR (150-170s) with SBP in the 70-80s 
and evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR, limiting both medication 
and fluid administration on the floor. In the CCU the patient 
was treated with amiodarone. She converted to sinus tach after 
150 mg loading dose. Patient subsequently called out to the 
floor and was continued amiodarone PO 400 mg BID x 1 week 
(___) and then was switched to 400 mg daily through ___. 
Unfortunately, on ___ patient once again developed afib with 
RVR into the 130s. Blood pressures initially were ___ systolic, 
but her pulmonary edema significantly limited fluid 
administration and her low SBPs limited further medication 
administration. Given the patient and family's goal of keeping 
the patient as comfortable as possible, the decision was made 
not proceed with IVF bolus, knowing the potential for further 
respiratory compromise, and not to proceed with ICU transfer. 
The patient's pressures subsequently dropped to 50/D and the 
patient's breathing became more labored. The entire family was 
informed of the situation and they were asked to come to the 
patient's bedside. With the family present, the patient was 
subsequently given low doses of IV morphine titrated to 
non-labored breathing. The patient passed away with the family 
at the bedside around one hour later. 

CHRONIC ISSUES
# Anemia: Patient with downtrending Hct since admission with no 
obvious source of bleeding. Guiaic of stools and hemolysis labs 
were negative. Hct at the time of death 29.9.

This is a ___ year old male with a history of coronary artery 
disease (CAD) status post PCI and stents, HTN, and 
hyperlipidemia who comes in with chest pain.  

 
#. Chest pain: Unclear if this is truly cardiac in nature as 
patient has had multiple admissions in past month for chest 
pain. Patient is a poor historian, however given elevation in 
troponins at an outside hospital and non specific ECG changes, 
there was concern for in stent thrombosis.  There was also a 
concern for aortic dissection given repeat admissions and high 
blood pressure.  A CTA was negative for dissection.  He refused 
a nitro drip in the ED.  The decision was made to take him to 
cath to evaluate for in stent thrombosis.  His stents were 
patent, no new stents were placed.  He does have diffuse 
coronary disease and at this time has not stentable lesions.  
His chest pain was thought to be due to a mix of musculoskeletal 
disease with an element of ischemic disease that was being 
medically managed.  He was continued on a statin, a beta 
blocker, and ACE-inhibitor, plavix and an aspirin daily. He was 
started on amlodipine for further anti-anginal therapy. He was 
given a 20 day supply of vicodin for chronic chest pain symdrome 
and an appointment was made with his primary care doctor to 
follow up.  
 
#. Pump: Patient with preserved EF. Not in heart failure 
clinically. Will continue to monitor.  

#. HTN: He was initially having elevated blood pressures into 
the 180s.  He was given his home medications and a one time IV 
dose of hydralzine.  His pressure responded.  after his cath his 
pressures were on the low side.  He responded to gentle fluid 
boluses and after getting up and walking with physical therapy 
his pressues improved.  
 
#. Chronic pain: Patient has been noted to have some drug 
seeking behavior. Has been noted to request IV pain meds 
multiple times. He was pain controlled with oral vicodin and 
given a short supply to cover him before he could meet with his 
PCP.

Mr. ___ is an ___ year old male who was admitted on ___. 
He was initially transferred to the ICU for management and was 
transferred out of the ICU on ___. Below are the events 
that transpired during his hospital stay.
.
Neurology: 
Right temporal hemorrhage. Stable on repeat CT scans. Had BP 
parameters < 160. HOB greater than 30 degrees. Able to move his 
right upper and lower extremities spontaneously. Opens eyes and 
follows some commands. He is moving left lower extremity in the 
plane of the bed, but he is not moving his left upper extremity. 

.
Cardiovascular:
BP medications were adjusted. He is currently on amlodipine, 
lisinopril, and metoprolol. He was started on clonidine in the 
surgical ICU. We have started HCTZ for further blood pressure 
control. We discontinued his clonidine on the day of discharge.
.
ID:
Spiked fever in ICU. U/A was positive and was initially started 
on ciprofloxacin. Remained febrile and urine culture grew 
Enterococcus. He was started on linezolid (in case of VRE b/c he 
remained febrile). Despite linezolid, fevers persisted. He 
underwent bronchoscopy. Prior to culture data becoming available 
and because he was still spiking daily fevers, abdominal source 
was sought after and an abdominal U/S performed. The study 
revealed a distended gallbladder w/ sludge and was concerning 
for possible acute cholecystitis. HIDA scan was performed for 
further evaluation, which revealed chronic cholecystitis. 
Surgery consult was obtained and no immediate intervention was 
recommended. 
.
Cultures from BAL eventually grew enterobacter and Kliebsiella. 
ID was consulted. He is completing an 8 day course of treatment 
for treatment of VAP. His antibiotics for treatment of PNA also 
covered Enterococcus from urine culture. Therefore, his UTI is 
adequately treated. 
.
Pulmonary: 
Was intubated in the ICU for airway protection initially. He is 
s/p trach and maintaining good O2 sats on trach collar. 
.
Gastrointestinal:
Had PEG tube placed for nutrition in the ICU. His tubefeeds are 
Boost Glucose control (full strength). We add banana flakes on 
his tubefeeds. His rate is 60cc/hr and his residual checks 
should be every 4 hours. Tubefeeds should be held for residuals 
greater than 200cc. His PEG tube should be flushed with 30cc of 
water every four hours. 
.
He had a speech and swallow consult on transfer to the floor and 
they recommended a PMV with oral care every 4 hours. 
Instructions for PMV care will be included in his discharge 
paperwork. He should continue with speech therapy at rehab.

General Care: Pt. should wear multipodus boots until he starts 
ambulating. He does have a Foley and Flexiseal are in place.

Mr ___ is a ___ with h/o ESRD (not on HD), HTN, anemia, 
T2DM, CVA ___ years ago), glaucoma, and recent admission for PNA 
who p/w syncope and HTN

#) Syncope: Unclear etiology but given confusion likely related 
to developing uremia from ESRD. Though he had mild hyperkalemia, 
suggesting a possible arrythmogenic cause, this is unlikely at 
that K value and given lack of concerning findings on EKG/tele. 
Monitored on tele and tx described below. 

#) Hypertension: BP on admission to the ED was 214/130 
consistent with hypertensive urgency given lack of clear sx. 
Likely related to ESRD and medication non-compliance. Baseline 
SBP 160-180 at home which were generally his BPs on the floor. 
He did decrease briefly to 140s after receiving home meds 
including hydralazine 50mg PO TID, amlodipine 5mg PO daily, and 
labetolol 300mg PO TID and on which he was continued. 

#) End-stage renal disease: Cr was 5 in ___, 8.6 2 weeks 
prior to this admission, and on admission ___ it is 7.9. These 
values are consistent with ESRD likely due to DM and HTN. There 
was no acute indication for dialysis during admission without 
volume overload, severely elevated K, evidence of pericarditis, 
or severe encephalopathy. The patient's hypertension, anemia and
hypocalcemia are likely secondary to CKD as well. He declined 
dialysis in ___ and he continues to not be interested in this 
option as evidenced by his missed appointment w/ Nephrology on 
___. Treated for hyperkalemia and acidosis as below. 
Received lasix 120mg IV x1 in ED. He was continued on 
calcitriol. The primary team and nephrology continued discussion 
about medication compliance and the importance of f/u with 
Nephrology as well as the risks and benefits of initiating 
dialysis but patient is uninterested in starting dialysis so was 
discharged home with recommendation to discuss this issue with 
PCP and family. 

#) Hyperkalemia: K 5.6 on admission with no evidence of T wave 
abnormality on EKG. He received insulin and dextrose in the ED 
and K improved to 4.5 on day of discharge. 

#) Acidosis: Mixed anion-gap and non-anion gap acidosis 
consistent with uremia/ESRD as non-AG acidosis likely ___ lack 
of titratable acid (NH4+) and AG acidosis likely from retained 
unmeasured anions. Lactate normal in ED. The patient was 
continued on home PO bicarbonate but declined consideration of 
HD. 

#) Diabetes: Stable on home glargine 14U AM and HISS.

#) Anemia: Likely ___ ESRD, stable.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-Labs are consistent with ESRD but patient continues to decline 
HD despite discussion of risks and benefits as inpatient. . The 
patient should discuss this issue with his PCP and family as 
well as a general goals of care discussion. 
-If patient is interested in HD and renal care, he should make 
an appointment with Dr. ___ at ___ as above.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
Ms. ___ is a ___ F with history of COPD here after cardiac 
arrest likely in setting of respiratory failure and acidosis. Pt 
was cared for in the MICU where she was intubated. Her HD status 
was monitored, and she required brief pressors. She was treated 
initially with broad spectrum abx given hypotension and concern 
for PNA on top of COPD exacerbation. Pt was initially extubated 
on HOD#2, but had increasing agitation and did not tolerate 
BIPAP and was reintubated. Reintubation was complicated by 
hypotension likely ___ propofol induction, requiring pressors. 
Abx were tailored to CTX for haemophilus in the sputum for 
planned 10 day course. She was continued on steroids with a 
taper. She was re-extubated on HOD#5.

# Post cardiac arrest: She likely had a PEA arrest in setting of 
respiratory failure. The post-arrest team was already consulted 
in the ER and recommended against cooling given short period of 
pulselessness. She was started on levophed for hypotension in 
setting of intubation and had dusky extremities but this was in 
setting of known Raynaud's and reportedly common for patient. 
Patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage for 
possible sepsis. PE was unlikely given her lack of findings on 
CTA. MI was unlikely given her reassuring EKG and her elevated 
troponin is likely related to myocardial leak from CPR. Serum 
and urine tox were remarkable for positive urine benzos but 
otherwise negative which suggested against ingestion. Her 
lactate and LDH elevations were likely in the setting of 
ischemia from arrest. Troponins were negative times three. Her 
HD status improved and she was weaned off pressors.

# Respiratory failure/COPD: Her respiratory thought to be 
related to underlying infection causing her URI symptoms of 
cough and runny nose or COPD exacerbation. Her chest xray and CT 
do not show any clear consolidation but her RLL opacity could be 
a developing pneumonia or related to aspiration during CPR. She 
was extubated the morning following admission and tolerated 
bipap for most of the day, however later that evening there was 
concern she was not tolerating BIPAP well and was reintubated, 
became hypotensive ___ to propofol required brief levophed, got 
more IVF's, bronch showed thick secretions at carina. Added 
tobramycin for double pseudomonal coverage. CTX grew out H flu 
and her ABX were peeled back to ceftriaxone and CAP. She 
completed a course of Azithromycin for COPD exacerbation.  
On HOD#5, pt was re-extubated and tolerated this well, and was 
able to be weaned to nasal cannula. She was placed on standing 
nebs, and transferred to the medicine floors.

On the floor she was started on spirvia daily and continued on 
albuterol nebs prn.  She was continued on ceftriaxone and 
cefpodoxime to complete her 10 day course.  She was placed on a 
slow prednisone taper.  ___ evaluated her and felt that she 
should go to rehab.  She was initially resistant but after doing 
poorly with physical therapy, agreed to go to rehab.

Of note her CTA on admission showed sequelae of pulmonary 
hypertension and was concerning for severe COPD.  The patient 
was set up with a pulmonary appointment at ___ and will need 
formal PFTs.  She also should likely have a TTE given concern 
for pulmonary hypertension.

# Acute haemophilus pneumonia: Pt with thick secretions from 
bronch as above. Sputum Cx prior to reintubation grew 
Haemophilus. He was treated with ceftriaxone and discharged home 
to complete a 10 day course with cefpodoxime.  

# Hypotension: Pt had hypotension with reintubation, thought to 
be most likely ___ propofol. She required brief pressors, which 
were weaned off. This resolved completely on HOD#4.

# Atrial flutter with RVR: Pt had runs of aflutter, likely ___ 
COPD, with rates in 150s, requiring Dilt while on CPAP. Once pt 
reintubated, this resolved. Pt was in sinus rhythm prior to 
transfer to medicine floors.  She was started on ASA 325 mg 
daily for CHADS2 score of 2 and started on diltiazem for BP and 
rate control (patient likely to go back into a.fib at some point 
in the future given right heart strain on CT/plumonary 
hypertension).

# Transaminitis: Most likely ___ shock liver in setting of PEA 
arrest. LFT's were trended, and improved prior to transfer to 
medicine floor.

# HTN: Pt became quite hypertensinve in ICU to SBP 180s in the 
MICU. Captopril was initially started and transitioned to 
lisinopril 40 mg daily.  Diltiazem was started and uptitrated to 
diltiazem 360 mg daily.  Chlorthalidone 25 mg daily was started. 
 She has PCP follow up early next week for blood pressure check.

# Severe atheromatous disease seen on CTA: Concerning for 
vascular disease.  Lipids were checked and were not very 
elevated, however she was started on simvastatin 40 mg daily due 
to the findings on CT.  HgbA1c was checked and was 6.2%.  

Transitions of care:
- Patient will need repeat chest CT in ___ months due to 
multiple nodules seen on chest CT here.  
- Check labs in 2 weeks for monitoring of 
creatinine/electrolytes on new BP meds.
- Check LFTs in 6 weeks on new statin.
- Follow BP and uptitrate/add more antihypertensives as 
necessary
- The patient noted that she had not sought regular preventive 
care in quite some time, and was aware of the importance of 
follow-up with a new provider following her rehabilitation stay.

1) Pyelonephritis: This was diagnosed based on fever, positive 
U/A and urine cx (cipro-sensitive E coli), recent untreated 
dysuria, L flank tenderness on exam, and suggestive CT with 
possible early abscesses. She was initially started on IV 
ciprofloxacin and IV metronidazole, although the metronidazole 
was quickly d/c'd, as well as IV fluids. Urology was consulted 
due to the concern for renal abscesses, and recommended 
repeating the CT is she becomes febrile again to assess for 
interval change in abscess formation and see if drainage is 
possible. Otherwise, perform an interval CT scan at 2 weeks 
after discharge. The latter recommendation will be followed 
since, by the time of discharge, she had been afebrile over 24 
hours. She was continued on PO ciprofloxacin to complete a 4 
week course per urology recommendation.

2) Tip appendicitis: This was noted on CT, but the patient had 
no anorexia, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal tenderness, making 
her clinical picture unusual for appendicitis. Surgery was 
consulted. She was kept NPO for the first 24 hours, and had 
serial exams by surgery. She remained asymptomatic, her diet was 
advanced, and she will follow up with surgery as an outpatient 
to discuss whether to proceed with appendectomy.

3) Hypercholesterolemia: Continued on lovastatin 40mg daily.

___ HD 1 POD 0: Pt came into the ED with severe abdominal 
pain.  He was noted to have a large right sided abdominal 
hematoma. He was made NPO and placed on IVF.  His pain was 
controlled and IV antibiotics were begun.  He was taken to the 
operating room where the large hematoma was evacuated, samples 
were sent to microbiology and pathology.  The hematoma had a 
foul odor to it. Two pin rose drains were left in place and the 
wound was left open with dressings layed on top of the wound.  
The nurses were taught how to change the dressing, as needed 
when the gauze was soaked through with blood.  Serial Hct's and 
vitals were monitored.  Pt had a Hx of MRSA 6 weeks ago at the 
outside hospital, thus was placed on precautions and a nasal 
swab was sent to the microbiology laboratory.

___ HD3 POD 2: Pt required increased oxygen with ambulation 
with desaturation to the 80's. Pt using IS 10 x/hr. CTA was done

Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with T-cell CNS 
lymphoma, DVT/PE, subdural hematoma admitted for cycle #9 
high-dose methotrexate. She tolerated the treatment well, but 
had some migraine headaches and nausea. 

Active Problems:
(1) CNS Lymphoma:  Admitted for cycle #9 of methotrexate.  
Patient tolerated the treatment well except for some migraine 
headaches, nausea, and transaminitis which she experienced 
during her last treatment cycle.  She was premedicated with 
Zofran and fosaprepitant. She received prehydration with sodium 
bicarb to maintain urine pH >7 to enhance methotrexate excretion 
and prevent kidney injury.  Patient's kidney function remained 
stable with treatment.  She was continued on gabapentin, 
verapamil, her home rizatriptan, and given dilaudid as needed 
for her headaches. Her dexamethasone was tapered to 0.75 mg 
every other day.  She was continued on keppra.  Patient's 
leucovorin dose was increased and her transaminitis improved. 
Her methotrexate level on discharge was 0.1.    

(2) Migraine Headaches:  Patient reports having migraines almost 
weekly, lasting a couple of days each.  She experienced some 
migraine headaches during this hospitalization with some nausea. 
 Her gabapentin was increased from 300mg to 600mg TID for 
migarine prophylaxis.  Her verapamil and vitamin B2 were 
continued for prophylaxis as well.  She continued to take her 
home rizatriptan and dilaudid as needed.  Her dexamethasone was 
tapered to 0.75 mg every other day.  Her migraines had improved 
upon discharge.

(3) Transaminitis:  LFTs increased slightly from baseline after 
the methotrexate dose.  Leucovorin was increased in frequency to 
q4h and her transaminitis improved. Her liver enzymes were noted 
to be elevated during her last methotrexate cycle as well. 

Inactive Problems:
(1) Chronic DVT/PE:  IVC filter placed.  No therapeutic 
anticoagulation due to recent subdural hematoma.  Continue 
subcutaneous heparin for prophylaxis.  
(2) Anemia:  Likely hemotherapy induced.  Mild, stable.
(3) SICCA Syndrome/Dry Eyes:  Continue eye lubricant and 
cyclosporine drops
(4) Nasal Congestion:  Continue outpatient fluticasone nasal 
spray.
(5) Glaucoma:  Continue timolol drops
(6) Constipation:  Continue laxatives/bowel regimen.

Transitions of Care:
1. Code status:  FULL
2. Contact:  Sister ___
3. ___ changes:
-DECREASE your decadron to 0.75 mg every other day
-INCREASE your gabapentin to 600 mg TID

Upon finding of intraperitoneal free air suggesting colon 
perforation, the patient was taken emergently from the ED to 
operating room for exploratory laparotomy (refer to Op Report 
for further details). In brief, intra-operative findings were of 
copious free air, purulent fluid and a thickened cecum with 
evidence of a small point of bile staining. The transverse colon 
was markedly dilated with some serial tear due to the dilatation 
but no gross perforation could be identified. However, the 
extent of pneumoperitoneum and the purulent fluid and with 
extensive fibrin over the cecum and right colon seemed to 
suggest that it a perforation had sealed itself off and 
therefore a loop ileostomy was performed. 

Post-operatively, the patient was admitted to the floor for 
further care. She was kept NPO with IV fluids and NG tube while 
awaiting return of bowel function. She was kept on IV 
antibiotics given the intra-op findings of purulent fluid in the 
abdomen, which cultured for Pseudomonas and (sparse) E. Coli. 
Her NGT and Foley catheter were removed on POD2, and she started 
on a clears diet which was well-tolerated and subsequently 
advanced to a regular diet. Home medications were resumed on 
POD3. Her ostomy initially had very high volume (as much as 3L 
per day) output starting on POD3-4 of liquid material; Immodium 
was started and titrated to control the output volume. By POD7, 
the ostomy output decreased to <1L/day and became more formed.  

During her hospitalization, the patient was also followed by 
Orthopedic Surgery because of prior left hip repair. They 
removed the staples from her ORIF left acetabular fracture 
operation. She was seen by the wound care/ostomy nurse. She was 
also seen by Physical Therapy who recommended discharge to a 
rehabilitation facility, but she and her husband felt she would 
be more comfortable and better cared for at home with services. 

By the time of discharge on POD9, Ms. ___ was tolerating a 
regular diet, voiding freely, and was able to ambulate with 
assistance. Pain was well-controlled on oral medications. She 
remained hemodynamically stable throughout the hospital course. 
Her electrolytes were repeated as needed, and she received 
anticoagulation prophylaxis with Lovenox (given recent hip 
surgery). She was discharged on oral antibiotics to be completed 
for a 14-day course. She had no neurologic, renal, endocrine, or 
heme issues. ___ services and home physical therapy were 
arranged to aid her further recovery at home.

The patient is a ___ man with a history of palindromic 
rheumatism, hypertension, chronic hepatitis B, and recent 
neurocognitive decline presenting for fever and enlarged, 
painful thyroid.
.  
# Thyroiditis, likely subacute granulomatous: The patient is 
likely suffering from a thyroiditis. Chest X-ray not suggestive 
of pneumonia, and urinalysis not suggestive of infection. The 
patient's only complaint aside from fever has been painful, 
tender thyroid. It was possible that the patient is suffering 
from an acute suppurative thyroiditis, but his age makes such a 
diagnosis less likely and his overall health after nearly a week 
also speak against a bacterial process. However, his Enbrel 
therapy does make him more susceptible to bacterial infection. 
The patient is much more likely experiencing either an 
autoimmune or viral attack on his thyroid, especially as TSH is 
reduced, or a toxic multinodular goiter. Both would explain 
fever and enlarged thyroid. Goiter definitely seen on US, though 
etiology is unknown. The patient lacks the delirium, 
tachycardia, and GI symptoms to suggest thyroid storm. TSH 
profoundly suppressed, and T4 and free T4 quite elevated. 
Endocrine consult confident that patient experiencing subacute 
granulatomous thyroiditis and have recommended that he follow up 
in ___ clinic for consideration of FNA of nodules once 
inflammation has resolved. Based on Endocrine recommendations, 
the patient's Unasyn therapy was discontinued. He was placed on 
standing acetmainophen and ibuprofen for symptomatic control. 
The patient will follow up with Endocrine for consideration of 
fine needle aspiration of nodules on the thyroid; his current 
state of thyroid inflammation makes FNA inapprpriate at this 
time. The patient will also need his thryoid function tests 
monitored as outpatient, as they should fluctuate follwoing 
resolution of thyroiditis. His atenolol was uptitrated to 25mg 
twice a day because he was experiencing tachycardia and a fine 
tremor.
.
# Diarrhea: Likely a direct side effect of the patient's Unasyn 
therapy, which has now been discontinued. The patient's C. diff 
toxin test was negative, and his diarrhea began to resolve once 
Unasyn was held.
.  
# Hypertension: Continued patient's uptitrated atenolol. 
.  
# Chronic hepatitis B: Continued Truvada therapy.
.
# Anxiety disorder: Continued clonazepam.

The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:

1. PICC placed on ___ with plan for 6 week course of vancomycin 
with Infectious Disease OPAT follow-up and appropriate 
surveillance and safety labs.
2. Intraop cultures were finalized as no growth to date at time 
of discharge on ___.

Otherwise, pain was initially controlled with a PCA followed by 
a transition to oral pain medications on POD#1.  The patient 
received Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of 
POD#1.  The foley was removed on POD#2 and the patient was 
voiding independently thereafter. The surgical dressing was 
changed on POD#2 and the surgical incision was found to be clean 
and intact without erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient 
was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout 
the hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the time of 
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling 
well.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The 
patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately 
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was 
neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign.

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity.

Ms. ___ is discharged to home with services in stable 
condition.

Ms. ___ was admitted to the gynecology service after undergoing a 
total laparoscopic hysterectomy, bilateral saplingectomies, and 
cystoscopy. Please see the operative report for full details. 
Her post-operative course was uncomplicated. 
On post-operative day 1, her urine output was adequate so her 
foley was removed and she voided spontaneously. Her diet was 
advanced without difficulty and her pain was controlled with 
oral oxycodone/ibuprofen/acetaminophen.  By post-operative day 
1, she was tolerating a regular diet, voiding spontaneously, 
ambulating independently, and pain was controlled with oral 
medications. She was then discharged home in stable condition 
with outpatient follow-up scheduled.

1. Nausea, Vomiting, Diarhea
There was concern for diverticulitis given imaging; however, 
patient was afebrile and without leukocytosis. It is unclear how 
immunosuppresed she is, and whether DMARDs would suppress a 
fever or white count. We consulted rheumatology to address these 
questions. They felt that MTX and Abatacept would not suppress 
an acute inflammatory/neutrophilic response as they are 
primarily t-cell mediators. In the absence of leukocytosis or 
fevers her symptoms were unlikely to represent serious bacterial 
infection such as appendicitis or diverticulitis. She was 
therefore treated supportively, with IV fluids, antiemetics and 
pain medicine. Overnight, she remained afebrile. Diet was 
progressed from clears to full liquids to solids, which she 
tolerated well. There were no episodes of diarrhea, and thus no 
stool for culture or C diff. Her abdominal tenderness improved 
significantly. Urine output was excellent. We believe her 
symptoms were due to gastroenteritis. Toxin-mediated diarrhea 
(food poisoning) was another consideration as her symptoms 
developed in close proximity to ingesting tuna fish.

2. Rheumatoid Arthritis
As above, we continued her RA regimen. Rheumatology was in 
agreement. Home pain meds were continued.

3. Benign Hypertension
We continued her home dose metoprolol.

Subcutaneous heparin was used for DVT prophylaxis. Her code 
status is full.

The patient presented to the Emergency Department on ___. 
The patient referred a painful left inguinal bulge and had a CT 
abdomen/pelvis scan that showed an incarcerated hernia 
containing fat. Due to an incidental left pleural effusion, 
interventional pulmonology was consulted for placement of a left 
pigtail chest tube which drained 2L of serous fluid. Following 
this, the patient was taken to the operating room for left 
incarcerated inguinal herniorrhaphy. There were no adverse 
events in the operating room; please see the operative note for

#. Legal/Safety:
Mr. ___ refused to sign a conditional voluntary agreement and 
was admitted on a ___ on day of admission. That evening 
patient signed a CV, however this was rejected due to concern of 
patient's lack of understanding about his current presentation, 
ongoing irritability, and refusal to accept or engage in 
treatment. Patient later became more engaged in treatment and 
signed a conditional voluntary which was accepted; he also 
signed a 3 day notice that expired on ___. Of note, despite 
some intermittent irritability, patient maintained his safety 
throughout his hospitalization and did not require physical or 
chemical restraints. 
.
#. Psychiatric: Depression, emotional lability
- Mr. ___ is a ___ single, domiciled, unemployed, 
male student from ___ with self-reported 
history of depressive episodes, organizational difficulties, 
cannabis use, no hospitalizations or suicide attempts and no 
past medical history who self-presented to the ___ ED for 
suicidal ideation, and demonstrating odd behavior and paranoid 
thinking. On initial presentation, patient reported long 
standing depressive mood symptoms, auditory hallucinations, 
paranoid/bizarre delusions, and a long history of intermittent 
substance use with a focus on cannabis. Collateral on admission 
was notable for concern for the patient's daily functioning, and 
ability to remain safe in the community. 
- Mr. ___ presentation is complex and given history of 
school difficulties, there may be a component of low distress 
tolerance as a result of underlying learning disability or 
possible autism spectrum disorder, especially in light of 
possible diagnosis of Asperger's as a child per his mother, and 
concrete thought process with evidence of poor mentalization. 
This may interplay with adjustment disorder given multiple 
recent significant events and life changes which have been 
distressing for the patient. Additionally, given reports of 
depressed mood with problems with schooling, low self esteem, 
feelings of hopelessness and helplessness, hypersomnia and 
occasional passive SI, and increasing irritability, affective 
disorders such as depression or bipolar disorder could also be 
considered. Lastly, patient does report some vague paranoid 
thinking, and seems concrete in his thinking concerning for 
possible psychotic component to his presentation, however given 
its temporal association with marijuana use, and the fact that 
this resolved in the absence of cannabis use, makes a degree of 
substance induced psychosis most likely.
- During his hospitalization patient was started on risperidone 
0.5 mg QHS for irritability, and paranoid thinking. Patient 
tolerated initiation of this medication well, and without side 
effects and with some apparent improvement in his irritability. 
- He had intense periods of irritability throughout his 
admission, however was generally able to self regulate and did 
not require physical or chemical restraints. Patient attended 
occasional groups with variable participation, however was more 
engaged with treatment throughout his admission. He engaged 
appropriately with his peers on the unit. 
- On discharge, patient was set up with intensive outpatient 
program in the evenings, to continue to work on coping skills 
and distress tolerance. Additionally, patient was counseled to 
stop smoking marijuana as this can worsen his mood, increase 
paranoia, and impair his ability to tolerate distress. 
-  At discharge, patient reports improvement in mood, and 
hopefulness for his future. He denies any passive or active 
suicidal thinking. He denies any significant paranoia or 
perceptual disturbances. 
.
#. Cannabis use disorder:
- Patient with ongoing cannabis use prior to presentation. 
Patient was counseled on the negative effects of cannabis use 
and the recommendation to remain substance free at discharge. He 
was scheduled with follow up to continue cannabis use 
counseling..

obstruction.  She was being treated for a presumed H. pylori 
gastritis on admission and we continued her H.pylori therapy.  
We gave her IV fluids and IV antiemetics and her 
nausea/vomitting improved.  She was able to tolerate POs at the 
time of discharge.  Most likely her symptoms were related to her 
chronic disorder and she will need f/u with her PCP as an 
outpatient.  We will discharge her with her home 
pain/anti-emetic regimen and will prescribe zofran ODT to see if 
helps provide additional symptom relief.
.  
# Low back pain - Presentation consistent with her chronic back 
pain, no red flag/warning signs or symptoms.  Pain could have 
been exacerbated by retching.  She was seen by Pain during her 
last admission who recommended conservative management with 
tylenol and tramadol.  We continued her home pain regimen and 
her pain resolved prior to discharge.
.
# Tachycardia - Sinus tachycardia on EKG.  Likely related to 
combination of pain/anxiety/dehydration.  Treated with IVF.  
Improved overall. 
.
# Diabetes Mellitus I, poorly controlled with complications - 
Patient with frequent admissions for DKA, although no gap with 
this admission. Blood sugars showed good control.  She was 
maintained on home regimen of lantus 28 units qhs and SSI
.
# Failure to thrive as outpatient - Patient has frequent 
admissions for N/V and DKA with 4 in past 3 months.  Psych was 
consulted during a recent admission and recommended outpatient 
therapy but she did not continue outpatient psyc therapy because 
she did not like it.  Social work was consulted and a family 
meeting was held.  She will be discharged with nursing services 
as well as transportation/community support services arranged by 
social work.

Mr. ___ was admitted on ___ to the trauma SICU for 
close observation given his diagnosis of perforated 
diverticulitis and free air seen on CT scan. He did not have 
evidence of peritoneal signs on exam and was only moderately 
tender. He was kept NPO and aggressively resuscitated. He was 
also started on IV cipro/flagyl. His heart rate in the ICU was 
poorly controlled in the setting of atrial fibrillation. This 
improved with diltiazem and on HD 2 he was restarted on his home 
doses of sotalol and digoxin. Overall he did well in the ICU 
with improved abdominal exam so was transferred to the floor on 
___.

On the floor he was monitored on telemetery and he remained in 
atrial fibrillation with rate well controlled. His vital signs 
were routinely monitored and he remained afebrile and 
hemodynamically stable. His oxygen saturation decreased to the 
80's on room air but was in the mid to high 90's on minimal 
supplemental O2 via nasal cannula. Pulmonary toilet and 
incentive spirometry were encouraged and he was started on 
nebulizer treatments. A chest x-ray on ___ showed significant 
improvement with only minimal residual signs of CHF. I&O's were 
monitored and he was voiding adequate amounts of urine. He was 
started on SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis. His blood glucose was 
monitored and he required very minimal coverage with insulin 
sliding scale, with his blood sugars remaining in the 100's 
throughout his hospital stay.

Ms. ___ has a history of stage III CKD and initially 
presented with a creatinine of 3.7 (baseline 1.2-1.5). She 
likely had AIN secondary to nafcillin therapy. She presented 
with the triad of fever, eosinophilia and elevated creatinine. 
Urine eosinophils were negative but her urine sediment 
demonstrated WBC casts. Her renal U/S was normal as was her 
SPEP. Her creatinine improved after discontinuing nafcillin.  
Her PPI and plavix were continued (although they can also cause 
AIN) given other indications for use (GI bleed and recent 
cardiac stenting). She was seen by Renal and briefly started on 
PO prednisone (one dose, 40mg) for AIN, but given her creatinine 
improvement to near baseline and potential risk of GI bleed on 
steroids, her steroids were d/c'd as the risk was felt to 
outweigh the possible benefit. Her creatinine was 1.4 at the 
time of discharge. Close ___ is indicated to trend 
creatinine and ensure resolution of AIN. She should get a chem10 
one week from discharge and ___ with Dr. ___

Ms. ___ was transitioned from Vanc/Cefepime to Cefazolin for 
continue treatment of her MSSA bacteremia once we felt she did 
not have HCAP. However, she developed a non-blanching, 
mobilliform rash across hands and upper extremities after 
starting on cefazolin for 1 day. She subsequently had an 
eosinophilia which peaked at 23%. She Complained of some 
pruritis but did not require any medication for relief of 
symptoms. The cefazolin was switched to vancomycin for the 
duration of her antibiotic course. Most likely the rash 
represents an exanthematous drug eruption ___ to cefazolin use. 
Eosinophilia and rash now resolved at the time of discharge and 
in the setting of one dose of predisone which eliminated the 
eosinophils.

# MSSA Bacteremia:

___ yo woman with H/O complete heart block s/p cardiac arrest and 
subsequent dual-chamber pacemaker placement (originally ___, 
last revised ___, CAD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type II 
DM presenting with worsening exertional chest pain. Patient was 
admitted to cardiology service. Her second troponin-T returned 
elevated to 0.22, and she was started on heparin drip for 
NSTEMI. The following summarizes her issues during this 
hospitalization:

# NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms consistent with crescendo 
exertional and rest unstable angina. EKG in ED largely 
uninterpretable to ischemia due to ventricular pacing without 
acute repolarization changes. Repeat troponin was elevated to 
0.22 so patient was started on heparin drip. Her beta blocker 
was up-titrated, her simvastatin was switched to atorvastatin 80 
mg daily. She underwent coronary angiography on hospital day 1 
that showed showed disease in the LAD, D1 branch, at least 
moderate disease in the OM (not commented on in the cardiac 
catheterization report) as well as subtotal occlusion in the RCA 
with extensive collaterals.  Attempts to pass a guidewire 
through the RCA stenoses were unsuccessful, suggesting a chronic 
recanalized total occlusion. Patient returned to the floor and 
remained chest pain free. The options of CABG, increased medical 
therapy alone, PCI to the diagonal and/or OM during this 
hospitalization, or deferred attempt at repeat PCI of the 
chronically occluded RCA (after the current guidewire tract had 
healed and when specialized equipment to tackle chronic total 
occlusions was readily available) were discussed with her 
primary outpatient cardiologist. The patient underwent nuclear 
pharmacological stress test on ___ that showed severe, fixed 
perfusion defect in the RCA territory and inferior wall 
hypokenisis. These findings were reviewed in conjunction with 
her coronary angiograms with several interventional 
cardiologists and her outpatient cardiologist. Although balanced 
ischemia in the diagonal and circumflex territories but worst in 
the chronically occluded RCA territory could not be excluded, 
the nuclear stress test was similar to her prior one in ___ and 
did not identify a culprit lesion for her worsening angina and 
NSTEMI. The ___ medical regimen was optimized by 
up-titrating her carvedilol to 25 mg BID, changing her 
simvastatin to atorvastatin, and starting Plavix as well as 
isosorbide mononitrate daily.  She will continue on her full 
strength aspirin as well as lisinopril and amlodipine (triple 
anti-ischemic therapy, dual anti-platelet therapy, high dose 
statin and ACE-inhibitor). There will be consideration for 
repeat PCI of the RCA versus CABG in the near future in 
discussion with her outpatient providers. An outpatient 
echocardiogram was scheduled to confirm viability of the 
territory supplied by the RCA (with right-to-right and 
left-to-right collaterals).

# Diabetes mellitus, Type 2: Only on oral agents at home, 
reports ___ were well controlled in 120s. Oral agents were held, 
and she was placed on ISS while in house.

# CHB s/p pacer: patient remained v-paced while in house, no 
issues.

# Hypertension: Patient's blood pressure was monitored. She was 
continued on lisinopril and amlodipine. Her HCTZ was held in the 
setting of catheterization and contrast load, carvedilol was 
uptitrated from 18.75 to 25 mg BID. Her diuretic regimen

The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:
On POD#1, the patient triggered for a blood pressure (systolic) 
in the ___.  She was given one-liter of fluids, which helped 
stabilize her blood pressure.

Otherwise, pain was controlled with a combination of IV and oral 
pain medications.  The patient received lovenox for DVT 
prophylaxis starting on the morning of POD#1.  The foley was 
removed and the patient was voiding independently thereafter. 
The surgical dressing was changed and the Silverlon dressing was 
removed on POD#2. The surgical incision was found to be clean 
and intact without erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient 
was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout 
the hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the time of 
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling 
well.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The 
patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately 
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was 
neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign. 

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity.

___ is a ___ year-old female with history of mild 
asthma, history of PE (not currently on anticoagulation), OCD, 
Tourette's, bipolar disorder, and intellectual disability who is 
admitted as transfer from ___ after unwitnessed 
fall on ___ AM with concern for head strike in the setting of 
supratherapeutic lithium level.

#Unwitnessed Fall:
Per her mother ___, patient had an unwitnessed fall from chair 
onto carpeted floor on ___ AM. Found to be groggy but 
responsive with mild headache with uncertainty about headstrike 
and low likelihood of loss of consciousness though patient does 
not remember fall. This was in the setting of poor PO intake and 
weight loss in context of psychiatric medication changes dating 
back to ___. Non-contrast head CT showed calcifications but 
no hemorrhages. Cervical spine CT showed no fractures or 
malalignment. While syncope due to orthostasis is possible and 
cannot be ruled out, it is also possible that ___ slipped out of 
her chair and was too weak to lift herself up. EKG initially 
showed prolonged QTc in the ED but normalized upon arrival to 
the medicine service and monitoring on telemetry revealed no 
arrhythmias. Orthostatic vital signs were checked and were 
within normal limits. Seizure was felt to be unlikely given that 
patient is on topiramate and no focal signs or post-ictal state. 
She remained afebrile with no elevated WBC count and with stable 
vital signs during her stay and a urinalysis revealed pyuria but 
no concern for infection. She was given normal saline in the ED 
and D5W during the initial part of her stay with no reported 
dizziness, lightheadedness, chest pain, or shortness of breath. 
It is believed her fall was due to muscle weakness.

# Lithium toxicity:
___ was hospitalized overnight at ___ ___ 
for lithium toxicity > 2. At that time, lithium was 
downtitrated from 300 mg BID to ___ mg qAM and 300 mg qPM. Her 
lithium was found to be supratherapeutic at 1.7 while at 
___. She endorses subacute weakness; denies 
diarrhea (last BM ""few days ago""), dizziness, nausea, stomach 
pains, vomiting, slurred speech (mother notes improved 
comprehensibility of speech compared with last week), or 
tremors. Physical exam revealed mild lower extremity weakness. 
from ___ trending down to 0.9 (___). Initial labs revealed 
mild hypernatremia, hyperchloremia, and non-gap metabolic 
acidosis with elevation of creatinine to 1.2 (baseline kidney 
function not known). Her lithium was held since ___ AM with 
recommendation by psychiatry to hold until outpatient psychiatry 
appointment on ___. EKG in the ED initially showed 
prolonged QTc but normalized upon admission to the medicine 
floor. Urine electrolytes were checked due to concern for 
nephrogenic diabetes insipidus or Type 1 renal tubular acidosis 
and showed production of dilute urine, however, the results were 
difficult to interpret in the setting of her having received IV 
fluids. At discharge, her lithium level was 0.9.

#Hyperthyroidism
TSH found to be 02 (LLN 0.24) and Free T4 2 (ULN 1.7). 
Patient endorses weakness, emotional lability, and weight loss 
with diminished appetite. Denies anxiety, tremor, palpitations, 
heat intolerance, increased perspiration, or urinary frequency. 
Despite low TSH, free T4 is only mildly elevated so unclear how 
mild/severe symptoms would be. Differential diagnosis includes 
lithium toxicity (though lithium usually inhibits thyroid 
hormone release leading to goiter and hypothyroidism, 
retrospective studies have noted that hyperthyroidism is 
associated with ___ greater fold prevalence in those on ___ 
compared with gen population), Graves' disease, toxic nodular 
goiter, and painless subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis. Given 
thyroid exam was remarkable only for mildly diffusely enlarged 
thyroid with no irregular texture/nodularity and no findings 
associated with Graves' disease, Lithium toxicity and possibly 
subacute thyroiditis are most likely. She was advised to 
continue her home propranolol as this can be a treatment for 
elevated thyroid hormones levels and advised to ___ her 
thyroid function as an outpatient.

CHRONIC ISSUES
#Bipolar Disorder
-hold home Lithium
-Continue home Aripiprazole, Fluoxetine, Topiramate

#Asthma
-Continue home Albuterol nebulizer

#OCD
-Continue home Fluoxetine
-Continue home Clonazepam

#Tourette's
-Continue home Aripiprazole
-Continue home Propanolol

RESOLVED
# Long QTc: 
History of long QTc, unclear if this is d/t structural disease 
vs medication effect (she is on several psych medications that 
could contribute). QTc in the ED was 569 and QTc 455 on ___ 
on floor ___ night). Risk for Torsades de Pointes. Resolved 
to 387 on discharge.

# ?___: 
Cr 1.2 with BUN 14, baseline unclear. Given 1 L NS in the ED and 
D5W on the floor with improvement of Cr to 1. Likely 
intrarenal given BUN/Cr < 15 and no e/o obstruction. Lithium 
toxicity can lead to chronic tubulointerstitial disease. 
Baseline creatinine unknown. Stable at discaharge.

# Mixed gap / non gap metabolic acidosis: despite AG of 15, 
patient with delta gap of -7 and worsening of her acidosis after 
NS indicating a concurrent hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. 
Improved during stay. Possible chronic component, and 
recommended outpatient followup

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
--------------------
1) Please do not take Lithium until you are seen by Dr. ___ 
on ___
2) Consider re-checking kidney function, serum electrolytes, and 
urine electrolytes, as well as plasma ADH if concern for chronic 
kidney injury or diabetes insipidus.
3) Consider re-checking thyroid function as TSH was low and free 
T4 were high during hospitalization.

ACUTE/ACTIVE ISSUES:
====================
# Toxic metabolic encephalopathy 
Patient was at home and conversant and oriented at baseline. 
Needing hoyer lift for moving since his recent hospitalizations, 
rehab stays following the SDH. Hetarted to become confused three 
days prior to presentation and then had hallucinations. He 
presented with fluctuating mental status, confusion thought to 
be toxic metabolic in the setting of urinary tract infection and 
intraventricular hemorrhage. Basic lab work without other 
metabolic derangement. Through the first few days of his 
hospital course his mental status was fluctuating, more 
somnolent around 5pm, alert and oriented in the morning. Likely 
consistent with hypoactive delirium. His mental status improved 
after treatment of UTI and COPD exacerbation as below.

No evidence of complication on renal ultrasound. No definitive 
growth on culture. Received 1x dose vancomycin. Started on 
cefepime (st ___. Switched to Ceftriaxone to complete 7 day 
course of antibiotics that completed ___.

#Intraventricular hemorrhage 
#History of SDH
Spontaneous small IVH iso supratherapeutic INR to 12 in the 
setting of recently restarting warfarin s/p reversal at ___ with 
improvement to 1.2. He was transferred to ___ for 
neurosurgical evaluation. Neurosurgery evaluated the patient, 
reviewed imaging and recommended no surgical intervention. His 
INR increased during his hospital course up to 3.3. After 
discussion hematology, he was given vitamin K IV 10mg for three 
days as the increase in INR with INR rose slightly as above. 
Neurology was consulted at the recommendation of neurosurgery to 
discuss timing and safety of restarting anticoagulation (for 
atrial fibrillation with Chads2vasc score 6. MRI brain was 
performed with assistance from consultation with the cardiology 
MRI pacemaker team. MRI showed MRI multiple subcortical old 
infarcts (most
likely baseline cognitive impairment is due to vascular 
dementia, stable occipital IVH and superficial siderosis without 
microbleeds which seems most likely secondary to his prior TBI 
and chronic warfarin use given lack of microhemorrhages. 
Neurology recommended started apixaban 2.5mg BID as he has a 
high risk of stroke that likely outweighs the risk of bleeding 
while on anticoagulation (His Chads2vasc is 6 which is a 18.4% 
annual risk of ischemic stroke and his Has BLed is 5 which is 
12.5 % annual risk of bleed if he is on warfarin.) CT head on 
___ showed improvement from prior imaging with no evidence of 
further bleeding.

#Respiratory acidosis
#COPD exacerbation
Patient with diffuse wheezes and acute respiratory acidosis most 
likely COPD exacerbation. He was given one dose IV 
methylprednisolone, switched to PO prednisone ___ for a 5 day 
course of steroids (___). Started on azithromycin for 5 day 
course (___).

___ on CKD IV
Unclear baseline though with history of CKD stage III-IV. Cr 2 
in the setting of UTI, hypothermia, transient hypotension, and 
improved with fluids from Cr 2.2 at OSH. No CVA tenderness on 
exam. Now with low urine output. Renal ultrasound unremarkable. 
Baseline appears to be in the mid-2s per outside records but 
with low urine output there is concern for ___. Urine sediment 
showed granular casts noted in urine. Urine output improved. 

#Normocytic Anemia
#Thrombocytopenia
Unclear baseline with minimal IVH unlikely to significantly 
decrease H/H and plt. No evidence of schisocytes on smear 
suggesting against TTP. Iron studies suggestive of anemia of 
chronic inflammation, also possible contribution from poor renal 
function.

#Atrial fibrillation
#AV pacemaker
Underlying afib rhythm with mostly AV pacing and intermittent 
native beat. Supratherapeutic INR with IVH as above. Recently 
re-started warfarin as an outpatient. Pacemaker is:
___ Assurity ___ ___ ___ ___. Metoprolol 
was initially held then restarted. Anticoagulation started with 
apixaban 2.5mg BID at the recommendation of neurology.

Seizures were non epileptiform seizures and her EEG was normal.  
Likely related to stressors of withdrawl.  
.  
# Seizure - Patient had several seizures while in the ED and 
then had two more witnessed seizures while an inpatient.  They 
consisted of rhythmic moving in bed, no bowel or bladder 
incontinence, and no postictal period.  She was lucent and able

BRIEF SUMMARY:
============================
Dr. ___ is a ___ year old man with biliary atresia s/p Kasai 
procedure in ___, recurrent cholangitis with last episode 
___, not on suppressive therapy, advanced liver fibrosis with 
no diagnosis of cirrhosis, and history of C. diff infection, who 
presented with symptoms and signs concerning for a further 
recurrence of cholangitis, improved and discharged on 
antibiotics.

============================
DETAILED SUMMARY BY PROBLEM: 
============================
#Cholangitis
Patient notably has a long history of recurrent cholangitis, 
secondary to a past medical history of biliary atresia that was 
corrected surgically with a ___ procedure at 6 weeks of age.  
He noted that since roughly his teenage years he has had several 
repeated admissions to various hospitals for bouts of 
cholangitis.  He recently has experienced ___ episodes of these 
admissions per year, always responding to intravenous 
antibiotics.  He notes his most recent ERCP during one of these 
admissions was back around ___ in ___.  Patient noted that 
his last episode of cholangitis was in ___.  He reported that 
he had a limited outpatient supply of Augmentin, which he had 
been taking on his own during a previous hint of abdominal pain 
several weeks before the admission.  He noted a recurrence of 
symptoms progressing to intolerable abdominal pain, and 
subsequently presented to the emergency room with a fever to 
101.4. labs demonstrated elevated transaminases and total 
bilirubin as well as direct bilirubin.  Urinalysis was negative. 
 Right upper quadrant ultrasound demonstrated no evidence of 
biliary dilatation to suggest acute obstruction, so the patient 
was admitted to the floor and received intravenous cefepime and 
Flagyl.  Symptoms and liver function tests improved.  There was 
no need for consideration of urgent MRCP imaging or emergent 
ERCP. Patient resumed a normal appetite, with normal stooling 
patterns.  He was discharged on a 2 week course of antibiotics 
with high-dose levofloxacin.  He was instructed to follow-up 
with Dr. ___ in outpatient. 

# Status post ___ procedure: ERCP considerations are made more 
difficult in the case of Dr. ___ that his anatomy is 
markedly different due to the ___ procedure.  Upon further 
history obtained from the patient, it became clear that there 
was some record of his specific anatomic variation from the 
procedure that could likely be obtained from the operative 
report from the outside hospital in ___. The helpful nature 
of obtaining records of these results was discussed with the 
patient prior to discharge, and he was requested to obtain them.

#hemoconcentration:   Patient was monitored with daily CBCs, 
with some evidence of hemoconcentration appreciated as hospital 
course when on.  As patient was trialed off IV fluids this was 
thought to just represent decreased oral intake.  This resolved 
after patient made increased effort to drink adequately.

*Chronic Issues
#Biliary atresia:   Patient had some measure baseline of 
elevated liver function tests.  These were treated with home 
ursodiol, continued without issue.
#Depression:  home escitalopram was continued without issue.

============================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
============================

the eventual passage of flatus, diet was gradually advanced and 
the patient was transitioned from IV pain medication to oral 
pain medications. With the advancement to clears, converted to 
Lovenox for thrombosis prophylaxis and also started on ureteral 
stent prophylaxis with daily Macrobid.  Entereg was continued 
through first bowel movement. The ostomy nurse specialist had 
regular encounters and teaching visits and facilitated discharge 
needs/stoma care supplies.  Education on cystectomy diet was 
provided by nutrition services.  At the time of discharge the 
wound was healing well without evidence of erythema, swelling, 
or purulent drainage. Drain fluid was sent for creatine prior to 
removal. At discharge, the urostomy was perfused and patent and 
the ureteral stents were visible. Post-operative follow up 
appointments were arranged/discussed and the patient was 
discharged home with visiting nurse services to further assist 
the transition to home with ostomy care. He was discharged with

This is a ___ y/o F with hx of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (bx 
proven, end-stage, on double lung transplant list at ___), 
epilepsy w/ grand-mal seizures, and degenerative disc disease 
who presents with 2 day h/o fever to 102 at home and 1 day of 
n/v, in the setting of 12 days of constipation.

#Fever/Influenza A: Modest leukocytosis (11.4), CRP 180 (1 
on ___, and acute onset of high fevers with n/v suggested 
acute infection. Given high likelihood for flu, Tamiflu was 
begun almost immediately, prior to DAT. DAT for influenza A was 
+ on ___. Of note, given high concern for epidural abscess, MRI 
of L-spine was obtained and was not consistent with epidural 
abscess. She defervesced with tylenol; her last fever was at 
0230 on ___ (101.9). She did not have nuchal rigidity and her 
photophobia was nonspecific; likewise, her +___ was likely 
___ to her spinal stenosis and hx of dural tear, rather than an 
acute meningitis. UA was clean, so urosepsis was unlikely (no 
stone or obstruction seen on CT pelvis that would allow for 
normal UTI in setting of urosepsis). Of note, the n/v was likely 
due to the flu.

#Headache: This was very likely ___ flu, in which hyperemia of 
the sinus is causing increased pressure and the sensation of 
pain. The absence of purulent rhinorrhea argues against 
sinusitis; the fact that she is afebrile off antibiotics 
suggests that even if this was sinusitis, it would be viral. As 
above, exam and imaging studies not concerning for meningitis. 
Patient was instructed to monitor her temperatures at home. Her 
headache improved with pain medications and tylenol. 

#Nausea: Pt had fluctuating nausea throughout course. This is 
likely secondary to the flu, with some contribution from 
constipation. She was given IV Zofran on ___ for better 
control, and tolerated solid PO without vomitting. She was given 
a prescription for zofran to use at home as well. 

#Abdominal Pain/Constipation:  Likely cause of nausea/vomiting. 
Hypoactive bowel sounds most consistent with ileus. She had a 
large BM on ___. Her aggressive bowel regimen (Miralax bid, 
senna, colace, sorbitol) was continued in-house. She was given 
prescriptions for an aggressive bowel regimen. 

#Hyponatremia: Down to 130 on admission, up to 140 by HD3. POsm 
on HD1 was 270, while UOsm was 541, UNa was 93 and UUrea was 
534. In the setting of hypoosmolality, the concentrated urine is 
inappropriate; however, this is likely an osmotic phenomenon 
that may be explained by the elevated UUrea (perhaps secondary 
to subacute rhadbomyolysis with increased protein breakdown in 
setting of flu). Elevated UNa argues against hypovolemia. Other 
possibilities include nausea or pain induced ADH secretion, ADH 
secretion ___ meningitis/epidural inflammation. In any case, 
this had resolved by ___ and did not recur throughout course.

#Persistent cystic lesion in L pelvis: Noted on CT abd-pelvis on 
___, and has shrunk since ___. However, will benefit from 
pelvis U/S as outpatient. 

___: End-stage; pt is on double lung transplant list at ___ 
with initial workup there scheduled for ___. Followed by Dr. 
___ at ___.  She was continued on home prednisone, 
azithromycin.

#Spinal stenosis: Severe L2/L3 stenosis likely cause of back 
pain and leading to BLE weakness and numbness, as well as 
urinary retention. Unfortunately, she is not a surgical 
candidate at this time. Oxycodone SR (OxyconTIN) 60 mg PO Q8H 
was continued while in-house. 

#Urinary retention: Catheter in place; pt straight-caths at 
home.

#Epilepsy: Grand-mal/petit-mal seizures, congenital. 
Well-controlled on Oxcarbazepine, which was continued in-house.

#TO DO: obtain pelvic ultrasound as outpatient to evaluate for 
ovarian cyst.

Ms. ___ is a ___ year old G2P2 with a history of 
substance use, recently admitted  ___ for bilateral 
tubo-ovarian abscesses (TOAs), who was readmitted to the 
Gynecology after failing outpatient antibiotics. 

On arrival she was afebrile and hemodynamically stable, and she 
remained so throughout her admission. Her exam was notable for 
only mild lower abdominal tenderness in the bilateral lower 
quadrants without peritoneal signs. Her WBC and differential 
were normal. A pelvic ultrasound on the day of admission showed 
bilateral TOAs stable in size from prior (approximately 6-7 cm). 

Prior cultures of the abscess fluid from her last admission grew 
strep pneumo resistant to tetracyclines. The Infectious Disease 
team was consulted regarding antibiotic choice and recommended 
levofloxacin and metronidazole. She underwent two Interventional 
Radiology procedures: the placement of three transabdominal 
drains on ___ and then drain removal and aspiration of a 
single remaining collection on ___. It was decided that the 
drains would not remain in place until output was <10 ml/day 
(output ranged from ___ ml/day) because the patient was 
planning to leave against medical advice and was not eligible 
for home nursing services on account of her lack of insurance. 
At the time her drains were removed, there was near complete 
resolution of the TOAs, and the aspiration drained the remaining 
locule. Preliminary culture results from both drainages are 
showing no growth. Per Infectious Disease, she will remain on 
levofloxacin and metronidazole for 10 days following the last 
drainage (until ___.

Of note, she was diagnosed with primary genital HSV during her 
admission and was started on acyclovir as treatment with the 
plan to continue on daily suppression. She informed her partner. 
___, chlamydia, and trichomonas were all negative.

Regarding her substance use history, she was maintained on a 
nicotine patch during her stay but was in the pre-contemplative 
state of change. She had last smoked crack cocaine and marijuana 
the day prior to admission and showed no signs of intoxication 
or withdrawal. She was seen by a member of the Social Work team, 
and support was offered. 

She was discharged on hospital day 7 in stable condition with 
follow-up scheduled.

Service on ___ with abdominal pain. He had a CT scan that 
was consistent with acute cholecystitis. Informed consent was 
obtained and he was taken to the operating room for a 
laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Please see operative report for 
details. After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient 
arrived on the floor tolerating clears, on IV fluids, and IV 
dilaudid for pain control.  The patient was hemodynamically 
stable.

When tolerating a diet, the patient was converted to oral pain 
medication with continued good effect. Diet was progressively 
advanced as tolerated to a regular diet with good tolerability. 
The patient was unable to void post operatively and required 
catheterizations and was started on Flomax. After multiple 
attempts, the foley catheter was ultimately reinserted on HD3. 
During this hospitalization, the patient ambulated early and 
frequently, was adherent with respiratory toilet and incentive 
spirometry, and actively participated in the plan of care. The 
patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were 
used during this stay.

and APC, p/w persistent anemia, negative colonscopy, now 
transferred from OSH for single balloon enteroscopy to complete 
GIB w/u.  Also with recent dx of dCHF and worsening CKD.    
.
# Acute blood loss anemia 
# Acute upper GI bleed due to GAVE
Pt was transferred for single balloon enteroscopy to complete 
GIB w/u as etiology for anemia.  She underwent small bowel 
enteroscopy and EGD.  GAVE was noted with area of bleeding and 
one band was placed.  Enteroscopy was unremarkable. 
Post procedure pt still with heme+ stools and mild Hct drop. 
Capsule endoscopy was done on ___ results remain pending at 
the time of discharge.
SPEP was checked given anemia and worsening renal function and 
was normal.
.
# ___ on Stage IV CKD
Cr currently stable, however, there has been persistent 
worsening of her renal function this past year at an elevated 
pace.  Could be due to volume overload leading to poor perfusion 
of the kidneys, but also has other risk factors for renal 
disease, including diabetes and hypertension.  Worsening renal 
function may also be contributing to her anemia.  Renal was 
consulted and followed througout the hospitalization.  Renal 
ultrasound showed no evidence of renovascular hypertension.  
Urine protein:creatinine ratio was 4.9.  Ultrasound studies of 
both upper extremities were obtained to plan for dialysis 
access. Multiple lab studies were performed to further evaluate 
her renal disease; please see results section for details. HBV, 
HCV, ANCA and C3, C4 were checked and were WNL.  ___ was 
positive, of unclear significance.

# Diastolic CHF - new diagnosis made at ___ based on clinical 
presentation.  TTE was performed at ___ and showed no overt 
evidence of diastolic CHF but mitral stenosis, which could 
explain her volume overload.  She was diuresed prior to 
admission, currently appears euvolemic.  Her chief complaint of 
dyspnea of exertion could also be attributed to anemia.  Did not 
have any other sx's c/w heart failure.  Currently appears 
slightly hypovolemic.  BNP was checked and was elevated.  Pt 
appeared euvolemic at the time of discharge. Pt remains off of 
diurectics per Renal, although diuretics will be considered in 
follow up. 
.
# HTN, benign - patient has recently had poorly controlled BP, 
with several adjustments made to her blood pressure regimen.  
This raised possibility of secondary causes of HTN, especially 
in setting of worsening renal function.  Renal ultrasound showed 
no evidence of renovascular hypertension.  Patient's diltiazem 
and labetalol were continued. HCTZ and hydralazine were held.  
Losartan was resumed ___ once Cr was stable. BPs remained in 
150-190 range and renal recommended starting amlodipine which 
was done on ___.  Correction of pt's blood pressure should 
occur slowly over weeks to months given concern for possible 
ateriosclerosis given wide pulse pressure.
.
# DM2, controlled (A1C 5.6 in ___, with complications 
(neuropathy)
Continued statin and recently adjusted regimen of NPH and add 
HISS while in-house. Metformin  was discontinued given 
significant CKD.
.
# HLD: continued statin

difficulty clearing his oral secretions. The WBC elevated at 
17.5 from 14.1 on ___ and the BUN elevated 25 from 17 on ___.  
Patient was found to be in respiratory distress and started on 
broad spectrum antibiotics for treatment of VAP.
.
___ Course: ___ man with a h/o right cerebellar hemangioblastoma s/p 
resection c/b CVA / epidural abscess / herniation, now s/p 
anterior cervical discectomy followed by C3-4 fusion c/b post-op 
deltoid weakness and extubation / reintubation admitted to ___ 
for respiratory distress. 

# Respiratory distress / Ventilator Associated Pneumonia: In the 
neurosurgery service patient was noted to become progressively 
hypoxic despite being on high flow oxygen mask. His chest 
imaging demonstrated progressive parenchymal opacities that were 
thought to be from lower respiratory tract infection and likely 
mucus plugging. Given his muscles weakness he is thought to be 
impaired and limited ability to clear secretions. There was no 
radiographic evidence of PE from his CTA. He was started on 
vancomycin/zosyn/cipro for treatment of VAP.  Blood cx was 
negative. His respiratory distress responded markedly to 
antibiotics and pulmonary toilet. He had been on Zosyn for 
empiric coverage, but his sputum cultures demonstrate 
pan-sensitive E coli, and therefore he was switched to ___ 
with last day being ___. He was continued on pulmonary 
toilet with MIE, chest ___, mucinex and suctioning.  

# LLL COLLAPSE: Post obstructive and secondary to mucus plugging 
which resolved with aggressive suctioning and chest ___. Continue 
aggressive suctioning, chest ___, MIE device to augment cough, 
Mucinex, HOB to 30 degrees

# HYPERCARBIA: Chronic respiratory acidosis well compensated 
most likely from mix of chest wall noncompliance, neuromuscular 
dysfunction, and apnea. No prior documented history of 
obstructive disease.  he should have sleep study to evaluate for 
OSA.  He should also be considered for ABG as outpatient in 2 
months after his rehab stay to evaluate for improvement in 
hypercarbia. 

# S/p posterior cervical laminectomy, residual UE weakness. 
Decadron had been stopped by ___. Per neurosurgery no need for 
steroids, soft collar for comfort.  He was started on standing 
tylenol and oxycodone PRN for management of his pain. He will 
follow up with neurosurgery for further management.

# T WAVE INVERSIONS: Consistent with Wellens waves, suggesting a 
tight LAD lesion. She was asymptomatic and her first troponin 
was normal, however the second troponin was 03 (02 after 
re-running the specimen), so she was started on a heparin gtt 
and plavix. All other troponins, as well as CK-MB, were WNL. An 
ECHO showed mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction 
with hypokinesis of the mid to distal anteroseptal segments, 
LVEF>55%. She remained asymptomatic until the afternoon of ___, 
when she developed resting chest pain with dynamic T wave 
changes. Her pain was relieved with SL NTG x3 and 2mg IV 
morphine. She underwent cardiac cath on ___ which showed 30% 
proximal LAD, 70% small second diagonal, and 50% major OM 
stenosis, which were not intervened upon. Considering her recent 
bariatric surgery and presumed contraindication to aspirin, she 
was discharged on plavix. However, after a discussion with her

___ is a ___ female with PMH of opioid 
use disorder, alcohol use disorder and PID who was admitted with 
abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea thought initially to be 
enteritis but had worsening pain with repeat imaging suggestive 
of a ruptured appendicitis vs ruptured tubo-ovarian abscess. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#Ruptured appendicitis vs tubo-ovarian abscess
#Posterior cul-de-sac fluid collection
She initially presented with nausea, vomiting and diarrhea and 
diffuse abdominal tenderness on exam. Her initial CT scan 
demonstrated enteritis and was not definitive for appendicitis. 
Her pain then migrated to her RLQ and her exam was notable for 
peritoneal signs. She had a normal pelvic exam. Repeat imaging 
showed free peritoneal fluid with a posterior cul-de-sac fluid 
collection that was most likely secondary to ruptured 
appendicitis or a ruptured tubo-ovarian abscess (although the CT 
did not show conclusive evidence of either). We consulted 
surgery and Ob/Gyn. A ruptured ___ was thought to be less likely 
given her normal pelvic exam, but still possible. She was 
treated with IV ceftriaxone and Flagyl, then transitioned to PO 
Augmentin upon discharge. Radiology placed an U/S-guided 
catheter to drain the posterior cul-de-sac fluid collection on 
___. Abscess cultures negative. Both surgery and Ob/Gyn 
believed there was no indication for surgery during this 
admission. A reapeat CT showed interval reduction in the size of 
the fluid collections. 

#Pain management 
She had significant abdominal pain during this admission that 
improved but did not completely resolve at the time of 
discharge. She was managed with Tylenol, Toradol for 3 days, 
inuprofen and methadone maintenance. We discharged her to the 
___ ___ given her ongoing abdominal pain that was 
a risk factor for IV drug use relapse.

#Opioid use disorder
#Alcohol use disorder
She was initially placed on CIWA for alcohol withdrawal. She was 
started on methadone 30mg daily for opioid withdrawal that was 
up-titrated to 40mg daily. Outpatient follow-up for methadone 
maintenance therapy was arranged at ___. 
In case of relapse upon discharge, she was counseled on safe 
using and was prescribed Narcan. 

#Transaminitis: 
#Hepatitis C:
Her transaminases were initially mildly elevated (ALT 85, AST 
110) but resolved during this admission. She has known untreated 
hepatitis C. Her CT showed hepatomegaly with fatty liver as well 
as splenomegaly. Mild transaminitis could be secondary to 
alcoholic fatty liver disease as well as untreated hepatitis C. 
Acute alcoholic hepatitis was unlikely as we expect 
transaminases >1000. She was found to be hepatitis B nonimmune, 
and hepatitis A immune. She was given the first dose of the 
hepatitis B vaccine on ___. 

#Normocytic anemia
Iron studies ___ serum Fe, normal ferritin and low 
transferrin saturation 5%). B12 and folate normal. Normocytic 
anemia most likely from chronic alcohol use and component of 
mild iron deficiency secondary to recent heavy menstrual 
bleeding. No recent CBC to compare. Her hemoglobin remains 
stable at 9's, her discharge hemoglobin was 10.4. She was given 
ferrous sulfate. 

#Hyperkalemia 
She had elevated potassium levels near the end of her stay from 
5.7-6.1. The most likely cause was thought to be NSAIDs as she 
had been receiving ketorolac and then ibuprofen standing. After 
these were stopped, the potassium normalized, but she was given 
a dose of ketorolac on the night of ___ and it was elevated the 
following morning as well. She was given calcium gluconate x2 
although the EKG only showed minimal peaked T waves. Repeat 
potassium levels normalized prior to discharge. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#Routine Health Care Maintenance
Her reported outpatient meds are listed as: 
Fioricet 2 tablet TID (migraines), baclofen 20 mg TID, 
Gabapentin 800 QID, Antidepressant (Effexor has worked well, 
Celexa didn't work), Has been on Geodon (ziprasidone) at one 
point, worked well, Clonidine 2 mg BID (restarted ___
-A PCP appt was set up for her at ___ as above. 

#Anxiety: Per patient report, was on clonidine 2 mg BID. We 
started her on Clonidine .1 mg PO BID.

#Cocaine cravings: Reportedly took baclofen for this at 20 mg 
TID. Restarted at lower dose at 10 mg TID given concern for 
sedating effect. 

#Migraines: She was started on 1 tab fioricet TID. 

#Depression: She was started on Effexor XR 37.5 mg.

#Neuropathy: Unknown etiology, possibly alcoholic. She was 
started on Gabapentin 600 mg TID and Baclofen 10mg TID. 

#h/o NSTEMI: Unclear if due to hx CAD vs. cocaine abuse. No 
history of intervention per patient. No active chest pain, EKG 
reassuring.

#Asthma: Stable, no shortness of breath or wheezing.

#Tobacco dependence: She was given a Nicotine Patch 14 mg TD 
DAILY.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[] Please ensure patient completes course of antibiotics 
(Augmentin 875mg PO BID) until ___. 
[] Please ensure patient follows up with acute care surgery 
(appt ___ for possible appendectomy.
[] Please check a CBC and LFTs to monitor patient's anemia and 
transaminases
[] She was found to have common bile duct dilation (9mm) on 
ultrasound. If clinically indicated, consider MRCP. 
[] Please complete the hepatitis B vaccine series. Her first 
dose was administered on ___. 
[] Please assess patient's ongoing opioid use, and her progress 
on methadone maintenance. She was discharged with a script of 
Narcan. 
[] Please follow-up on housing resources for the patient. Seen 
by social work and offered resources while inpatient. 
[] Consider up titration or discontinuation of her previous home 
meds (gabapentin, Effexor, clonidine) as needed based on her 
symptoms of neuropathy, depression, anxiety.

dysphonia and concern for possible paroxysmal vocal dysfunction, 
ENT was consulted who felt patient's picture was not consistent 
with upper respiratory problem and would plan for outpatient 
laryngoscopy. A dynamic CT Trachea was done which showed TBM, 
though Pulmonary thought this was most likely not clinically 
significant. Pulmonary will refer to IP for possible Tx of TBM 
pending Pulm outpatient f/u. Plan is for steroids to taper 10mg 
qweekly.

# Leukocytosis: On admission the patient was noted to have a 
leukocytosis to 14.4. Given no localizing symptoms c/f infection 
and clear CXR, thought to be most likely due to steroids, given 
patient had been on steroids for a number of days and received 
an additional dose of 60mg (total of 100mg prednisone on day of 
admission). Her WBC was trended and returned to normal.

Admitted from OSH for 2d presumed superinfected hematoma & 
meeting SIRS criteria. This admission, supratherapeutic INR & 
Hct drop - resolved. (+)BCx, likely contaminant, wound cx 
w/Pasturella. 

Active Issues:
==============
# Sepsis/R Thigh Abscess/PNA: On presentation, met SIRS criteria 
with HR>90, WBC>12 with 93% PMNs and lactate >2.0. Started 
broadly on vancomycin/CTX/Azithromycin for suggestion of PNA on 
CXR. Wound found to be leaking small pus initially, drawn by 
Surgery & wound culture sent which grew out Pasteurella. Initial 
BCx also returned positive for Coag-negative Staph, though this 
was later thought d/t contaminant as subsequent BCx were 
negative (TTE also negative for vegetations). Pt received 4d 
vancomycin, 6d CTX, and 5d course of Azithromycin when coverage 
was narrowed to 2wks of Amoxicillin 500mg Q6H starting ___. 
Wound continuing to drain small amounts bloody fluid, though no 
pus, fluctuance, warmth, tenderness; pt should continue with BID 
wound packings at rehabilitation facility.

# Coagulopathy/Hematoma: INR supratherapeutic to 12.2 the day 
after admission, corrected with holding coumadin, 3u FFP & 5mg 
Vit K. Her Hct also fell to 21.9 while her INR was high, 
prompting infusion of 1u PRBCs. Her Hct stabilized in the 
mid-20s, and remained there as Coumadin was restarted. On the 
day of discharge, the pt's INR was 4.1, so Coumadin was still 
held. We recommend daily INR checks until her INR falls into 
therapeutic range (2.0 - 3.0), at which point Coumadin should be 
restarted at 1mg daily (with continued daily INR checks for 
monitoring and further titration).  

# Afib with RVR(CHADS2=4): Reported at OSH. Likely stress 
response to infections. Rate controlled here on dig & 
metoprolol. Anticoagulation as above.

# Volume Status/Nutrition - Intermittently tachycardic but with 
substantial swelling ___ b/l and UE, crackles on respiratory 
exam, and elevated JVD. TTE showed EF of 55% and normal systolic 
function. Cautious fluid resuscitation was provided, for a total 
of 1.5L this admission. Albumin found to be low to 2.4 though 
other synthetic function intact, indicative of chronic 
undernutrition. Diet supplemented with Ensures and encouragement 
to eat here. 

# Deconditioning: Evaluated by ___ here, found to have 
difficulties with transfers, ambulation, and generalized 
weakness. Quoting their note, ""Pt is currently well below her 
presumed ambulatory baseline living at home. Pt will benefit 
from increased OOB activity and reorientation as appears 
delerious but is pleasant and
cooperative. Pt will also benefit from skilled ___ to maximize 
function and return to ambulation but anticipate will require 
rehab stay upon discharge when medically ready. Pt has fair 
potential for return to household ambulator given age, prior
function and comorbidities.""

The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:
Overnight on POD#0, the patient was tachycardic to 110-115 and 
his urine output was borderline.  He was given a 500 mL bolus of 
fluid.  His heart rate and urine output stabilized post-bolus.  
On POD#1, his creatinine was elevated to 1.6.  He was given 
another bolus of fluid ___ mL).  Upon recheck, his creatinine 
was stable at 1.4 on POD#3. 

Otherwise, pain was controlled with a combination of IV and oral 
pain medications.  The patient received lovenox for DVT 
prophylaxis starting on the morning of POD#1.  The foley was 
placed by Urology in the OR.  Per their recommendations, the 
foley should remain in for one week after surgery. He will 
remain on Ciprofloxacin until the foley catheter is removed and 
is void independently. The surgical dressing was changed on 
POD#2 and the surgical incision was found to be clean and intact 
without erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient was seen 
daily by physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout the 
hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the time of 
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling 
well.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The 
patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately 
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was 
neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign. 

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity with posterior precautions.

___ y/oM with PMH of MR, schizoaffective d/o, seizure d/o, recent 
admission for ___ Syndrome c/b delerium and aspiration PNA 
who was initially readmitted to the hospital with presumed 
aspiration pneumonitis. 
.
In brief, the patient was initially admitted on ___ with 
tachycardia, hypoxia and abdominal distension.  Initial 
evaluation revealed leukocytosis to 20, dilated bowel loops, 
electrolyte abnormalities, and pulmonary consolidations.  His 
presentation was felt to be consistent with aspiration 
pneumonitis and an exacerbation of his ___ syndrome and he 
was treated conservatively with monitoring serial KUB and an 
aggressive bowel regimen.  He was also started empirically on IV 
vanco (stopped on ___ and ___ vanco/ flagyl for presumed 
cdiff, but this eventually returned negative.
.
Of note, his hospital course was c/b traumatic foley insertion 
on ___ causing gross hematuria.  Urology was consulted and 
recommended watchful waiting with placement of a coude foley 
catheter.  Hospital course also c/b slow development of 
thrombocytopenia with  platelets trending from 248 on admission 
to a nadir of 97.  Evaluation was with HIT antibody was negative 
and PPI, flagyl were discontinued due to concern that this could 
be a medication side effect.
.
On the evening of presentation, patient developed hypotension to 
80/60, tachycardia to 160s and fever to 103 and was noted to 
have approx 1 cp blood surrounding his penis.  Stat labs were 
obtained and showed a Hct of 18 from 27.  He was bolused with 
IVF (approx 2L), emergency blood was hung at bedside, zosyn x 1 
was given.  Transfer to unit was initiated for further 
resuscitation and hemodynamic monitoring. A ___ Coude foley 
catheter was placed urgently, with resulting hemostasis.  There 
was no further bleeding noted.
.
At the time of transfer to the ICU, his BP was 80/50s with 
tachycardia to the 150's and elevated lactate in the setting of 
fever and frank hemorrhage.  Etiology was unclear: evolving 
sepsis vs hypotension from hemorrhage.  CXR showed possible 
aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis.  Placed on empiric 
meropenem, iv flagyl, iv vancomycin, and ___ vancomycin as pt was 
having diarrhea.  Rec'd 2 U emergency transfusion.  Electroylte 
abnormalites with hypokalemia in the low 2's as well as 
potential hemodynamic instability prompted sterile placement of 
right femoral line for rapid electrolyte repletion.  Pt. 
stabilized and femoral line was removed.  Was aggressively fluid 
repleted, and also given additional transfusions of PRBC's. 
___ vanco and Iv flagyl were discontinued after c.diff negative 
x3.  Continued IV vancomycin 1000mg IV q12hr and meropenem 500 
IV q6hr were continued, and he completed 8 days of empiric 
therapy for HAP. Last day ___  
.  
During this time, there was concern for evolving severe sepsis 
given hypotension and elevated lactate.  Possible sources 
included HAP from possible aspiration or an intra-abdominal 
process such as c.diff with dilated colon, diarrhea/loose stool 
and recent broad spectrum abx.  Elevated coags on admission to 
ICU concerning for DIC.  Started abx's per above.  As pt was 
thrombocytopenic with fevers, DIC labs were checked for possible 
HUS, but came back negative. He became afebrile with above 
treatment, and his platelet count improved. HAP treatment 
completed during admission.
.
# Hematuria: secondary to traumatic foley placement with 
prostatic urethral tear. Resolved with placement of a 22fr Coude 
foley catheter. Pt had development of tea-colored urine ___ 
that resolved with clear urine in the foley and ___ with clear 
urine in foley. Urology came to evaluate the patient and foley 
flushed without difficulty there was no hematuria or clots seen. 
Given that foley had been in place for 2 weeks, urology 
recommended, DC foley and voiding trial. Pt was able to urinate 
after foley removal and no hematuria was noted.  Recommend 
follow up with Urology ___ weeks after discharge.
.
# LUE DVT:  During the admission, he was noted to develop a 
significantly swollen left arm.  Ultrasound confirmed a 
non-occlusive DVT in his axillary vein, and a totally occluded 
basilic vein. Notably, the patient did NOT have a line (eg PICC) 
in the left arm, so the cause of his DVT is not clear. The 
risk-benefit of anticoagulation in this patient with recent 
bleeding episodes was considered, and anticoagulation was 
discussed with ___, who felt that with a foley in place he 
is a low bleed risk.  His recent hematuria was not felt to be a 
contraindication for anticoagulation.  His recent GI bleed was 
felt due to erosive esophagitis, which is being aggressively 
treated with ppi and sucralfate, and GI bleeding appeared to 
have resolved.  Therefore, he was started on a cautious heparin 
drip, with transition to warfarin. Considering his history of 
bleeding, would recommend treating with warfarin for short 
term/such as one month, with reevaluation for discontinuation of 
anticoagulation at that time. Pt with supertherapeutic INR up to 
5.6, now 3.1. Would hold dose tonight, check INR tomorrow and 
consider resuming coumadin at 1mg. Goal is ___ INR but would 
prefer close to 2 given the above.
.
# Ogilvies Syndrome: profound colonic dilitation on x-ray in 
setting of known ogilvies thought to be due to fecal impaction, 
hypokalemia.  Followed by GI on floor with serial KUB's and 
aggressive bowel regimen resulting in copious loose stool on 
admission.  Empirically started on C.Diff coverage per above, 
but was negative x 3 so d/c'd. Colonic dilatiation appeared to 
be stable via KUB.  It is important to make sure that pt 
continues to have at least daily bowel movements, and that he 
does not become constipated.
.
#?coffee ground emesis upon initial admission-some concern of 
this in notes. Pt had not had any further episodes during this 
admission. GI evaluated the patient for Ogilvies syndrome as 
above. There is report of patient having ""erosive esophagitis"" 
at OSH and pt was placed on BID PPI. He will need an EGD as an 
outpatient after colonic issues and acute issues pertinent to 
this hospitalization have resolved. Pt noted to be guaiac 
negative with stable hematocrits aside from gross hematuria as 
above.
.
# Schizoaffective d/o, MR: He was followed by Psychiatry, who 
assisted with management of his periods of agitation. Recommend 
maintaining sleep-weak cycle as possible, judicious use of 
anti-psychotics given recent hx of tardive dyskinesia. Consider 
need for 1:1 sitter.  His agitation was treated with ativan and 
seroquel with benefit.  Patient was also often redirectable, by 
taking him for walks. Pt did become agitated ___ evening and 
did suffer a fall. Head CT was negative for acute injury.

1) Psychiatry
Patient was admitted to psychiatry from medicine for safety, 
stabilization and management of his depression. While he was on 
medicine he continued to express suicidal ideation and a desire 
to die and therefore was felt to require inpatient psychiatric 
admission after medical stabilization. Upon presentation to 
psychiatry, he denied current suicidal ideation, reporting that 
he was feeling more cared for since his wife and sister entered 
back into the picture.  He reported concern if he were to return 
to the streets, he would likely relapse to benzo use. It was  
discussed with the patient that while people can provide 
support, ultimately he is the only one who can ensure his 
sobriety, which he understood.  He eventually expressed the 
realization that his use had high consequences, and that his 
marriage/relationship/health were on the line. As he complained 
of neurovegetative symptoms, and that in the past he responded 
well to Remeron, he was started on Remeron and titrated up to 
15mg qhs. His therapist was contacted who confirmed that while 
the patient does not have a formal psychiatric history, she was 
concerned with his safety on the streets as he has been 
demonstrating an inability to take care of himself from a 
medical standpoint, in part due to cognitive effects of the 
hepatic encephalopathy. Patient was somewhat withdrawn on the 
unit, sticking mostly to his room but did participate in some 
groups. He reported that he was sleeping well here and denied 
any thoughts of self harm or suicidal ideation while on the 
unit.   It was felt therefore that the patient no longer 
required an inpatient level of care for his depression and from 
a psychiatric standpoint, was safe for discharge.  Pt was 
interested in attending a day program, working part time, or 
volunteering to occupy his days once discharged, and he hoped 
___ might help him in this. At the day of discharge, 
patient reports that he is feeling hopeful about the future, 
feels he has made progress during this admission, and has many 
reasons to try and stay sober - his wife, his sister, his ___ 
and the things he still looks forward to doing. While he 
reported anxiety in facing all of this, he is also hopeful about 
the future and ready for discharge. At this time, he is felt to 
be safe and appropriate for discharge.

2)Medical
Patient was admitted from medicine. There was a question in 
terms of the status of his liver failure. Patient's PCP ___. 
___ was contacted who confirmed that the patient was in 
end stage liver failure. He reportly was not a transplant 
candidate because of the benzo and methadone use. Further, Dr. 
___ reported that the patient have a substantial longer 
life span and could have many more years if he was compliant 
with his medication.  However, as the patient is not compliant 
with his medication, his situation is more dire.  Discussed with 
the patient the need for taking the lactulose. Patient 
understood the need for taking the medications, but that he does 
not like the side effects and notes how difficult the side 
effects are to manage when homeless.  Additionally, patient has 
not been compliant with his insulin for some time, so a HgA1C 
was ordered which was 6.3.  As his HgA1c in ___ was 5.5, it 
was felt that his diabetes was mod well controlled, and given 
the multiple concerns regarding compliance after discharge, 
further investigation into his diabetes was not conducted. On 
hospital day 6 pt developed RLE calf redness and pain, as well 
as a fever and increased blood glucose values, in the high 300s. 
 He was evaluated w/ an U/S that was negative for a DVT.  He was 
felt to have either cellulitis or superficial thrombophlebitis, 
and pt was treated first with IV Unasyn, as well as hot packs 
and ibuprofen for pain.  He was switched to PO Augmentin for an 
anticipated total of 11 days.  Medicine was consulted and they 
followed the pt until he was transferred to PO antibiotics.  Pt 
was thrombocytopenic, plts 83-165K likely secondary to liver 
disease. His blood sugars trended downwards and the elevation 
was considered to be secondary to the infection.  F/u w/ pt's 
PCP was arranged before discharge.

3) Psychosocial
SW was in contact with patient's wife to provide psychoeducation 
and support. She was involved throughout her stay and came in 
for a family meeting.

4) Legal
Patient was admitted on a ___ and signed in on a CV.

5) Disposition
It was felt that the patient would not be able to care for 
himself if he were back on the streets.  He did not meet level 
of need for a medical hospitalization @ ___, and he was 
accepted at ___.  Additionally, it was felt 
that he would benifit from referral to a day program to help 
maintain his sobriety, and suggestions were given to ___ 
___ that the patient be referred to a day program as 
well as some referrals.

PATIENT SUMMARY:
====================
___ ___ only speaking female with past medical 
history significant for asthma, hiatal hernia, GERD, 
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, glaucoma, chronic back pain, 
hypothyroidism, pancreatic insufficiency who presented to the ED 
with acute on chronic back pain concerning for potential spinal 
cord pathology, worsening shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, 
and abdominal pain, admitted to the medical floor for further 
evaluation and treatment.

====================
ACUTE ISSUES:
====================
#Hypoosmolar hyponatremia
Noted to have a serum sodium of 127 on ED presentation (treated 
as chronic as present on admission, moderate), down trended to 
125 (measured in whole blood) over following 24 hours after 
receiving IV NS. C/o early signs of hyponatremia: headache, 
nausea, fatigue. Pt had recently started HCTZ which may have 
induced decreased intravascular volume with renal salt losses. 
After volume expansions and by the time of arrival to the floor 
appeared euvolemic, yet urine osms remained high. This remained 
true even with discontinuation of HCTZ and suggests SIADH, 
though full etiology may be multifactorial. Patient with no 
significant cardiac or liver history. No recent surgery or 
trauma. Does have history of hypothyroidism, though TSH 4.0. An 
AM cortisol was normal. ___ had one serum 
sodium sample for her that was 138 on ___. Given this 
subacute change, this could account for her generalized 
symptoms. Her sodium appropriately increased and was 131 in 
whole blood (and 130 in serum) at time of discharge. 

#Hiatal Hernia
#GERD
Patient reports long-standing history of hiatal hernia and GERD 
that at times lead to similar abdominal pain, nausea, and 
vomiting. Nausea and abdominal pain may be due to combination of 
hyponatremia (as above) and pre-existing hiatal hernia. ED 
evaluation notable for ECG with no ischemic changes, trop/MB 
negative x1, trop negative x2 and MB mildly elevated but was not 
trended due to atypical symptoms and negative troponins. BNP and 
CRP normal. Lipase and LFTs within normal limits. No other 
metabolic derangements noted. Patient remained afebrile with no 
leukocytosis. Chest x-ray unremarkable. CTA torso with no 
obvious/organic aortic or abdominal cause of the patient's 
abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Patient denies recent 
travel or sick contacts. No prior IBD/IBS history.

#Acute on Chronic Back Pain
#Weakness
Patient with a history of chronic back pain on gabapentin 
presenting with acute worsening within the past 2 days 
associated with subjective lower extremity weakness, inability 
to ambulate and cramping. Denied loss of bowel/bladder (although 
patient denied incontinence when asked on the medical floor). No 
falls or history of trauma precipitating worsening back pain. 
Evaluated by neurology in the ED and found to have adequate 
rectal tone but increased postvoid residual and hyperreflexia 
initially
concerning for possible cauda equina or spinal cord pathology. 
Follow-up w/ neurology found non-concerning exam and no longer 
recommended MRI. Weakness may have been due to de-conditioning 
vs. poor PO intake vs. hyponatremia. Physical therapy was 
consulted, upon their evaluation they recommended that she was 
safe to discharge to home. 

#SOB
#Asthma
On home regimen of albuterol PRN and ___. Patient does not 
remember if she appropriately used her inhalers in the prior few 
days before she started experiencing worsening shortness of 
breath. Patient reported that it is sometimes associated with 
exertion but not always. Ischemic cardiac workup negative in ED. 
Chest pain reported by patient most likely musculoskeletal given 
location and increased pain with deep breaths. Pt preferred 
albuterol inhaler to nebulizer and symptoms were well managed.

====================
CHRONIC ISSUES:
====================
#Hypothyroidism
Continued home levothyroxine

#HTN
Systolic blood pressures remained in 100-120s. Enalapril and 
HCTZ were held, due to fall risk if BP dropped too low. She was 
continued on her amlodipine.

#HLD
Continued home ezetimibe

#Glaucoma
Patient brought in own eye drops which were continued during 
admission. 

#Pancreatic Insufficiency
Continued Creon with meals.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[ ] Hyponatremia: please follow up BMP to assess [Na+]. 
[ ] Constipation: patient was complaining of constipation on day 
of discharge. She was given prescription for enema per her 
request.
[ ] Hypertension: Patient's SBP ranged between 100-120s and so 
most antihypertensives were held due to concern for fall risk. 
She was discharged on amlopidine 5mg; please follow-up if 
regimen needs to be re-adjusted once patient is managing 
medications at home

___ year old gentleman with Type II DM, hypertension, obstructive 
sleep apnea, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 
history of anaphylaxis/acute respiratory distress, nasally 
intubated at OSH, transferred to ___ for worsening hypoxia.   

# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure Complicated by ARDS: 
Etiology likely combination of angiodemea as well as aspiration 
event at OSH progressing to ARDS. Patient's body habitus also 
likely restrictive component making difficult to ventilate. 
Bronchoscopy was notable for thick left lung secretions.  BAL at 
OSH growing normal respiratory flora. Stopped paralytics on 
___. Sitting patient up improved patients PEEP requirement 
suggesting abdominal distention was contributing to 
trans-pulmonary pressures. Patient was continued on prednisone, 
ranitidine and cetirizine for treatment of angioedema. He was 
volume overloaded and received aggressive diuresis with Lasix. 
Tracheostomy was considered given significant airway edema, 
however patient clinically improved and was extubated without 
difficulty. He was treated for MRSA and enterobacter pneumonia 
with vancomycin and cefepime. He was then diuresed and 
successfully extubated on ___, after which he was transferred 
to the medical floor for further care. On the medical floor, he 
initially had a 3L nasal cannula O2 requirement, which decreased 
with improvement in his abdominal distension and SBO (see 
below).  He was successfully weaned to room air before 
discharge.

# Angioedema: 
Differential diagnosis includes angioedema secondary to ___ 
versus angioedema secondary to shellfish. Patient emergently 
intubated nasally at OSH. Received methylprednisolone, H1 and H2 
blockers at OSH. Nasal intubation exchanged for oral intubation 
on ___ with significant edema visualized. He was continued on 
prednisone and placed on a taper which finished on ___. He 
remained on zyrtec and ranitidine. Allergy was consulted and he 
will need to follow up with allergy as an outpatient. Of note, 
per discussion with outside providers, the patient has had 
multiple episodes of angioedema and has not been compliant with 
follow up. 

# Right upper extremity DVT: Pt had RUE swelling and was found 
to have totally occlusive RUE DVT from ___ line placed at ___ 
___. ___ line was removed and patient was started 
on apixaban. 

# Small bowel obstruction: Likely secondary to fentanyl gtt and 
critical illness. Patient was maintained on an aggressive bowel 
regime with Colace, lactulose, polyethylene glycol, senna, and 
methylnaltrexone. He had an NG tube placed for decompression and 
serial abdominal X-rays showed improvement.  His diet was 
advanced and he was tolerating a regular diet by ___.

# Acute toxic-metabolic encephalopathy: Pt noted to be confused 
after extubation.  CT head was negative, and mental status 
improved with resolution of his acute illnesses. Etiology was 
most likely due to acute illness and delirium due to 
hospitalization.

# Concern for OSA: Given his body habitus and increased O2 
requirement at night, he will need outpatient sleep study. 

# Nasal ulceration: Patient developed a nasal ulceration that 
was attributed to nasal intubation. He received wound care and 
this healed.

# Type II DM: Continued long acting insulin and a sliding scale.

# Hypercholesterolemia: Continued home Pravastatin 80 mg QHS.  

# Hypertension: Patient was restarted on amlodipine 5mg on 
___ but continued to be hypertensive to SBP 160s-170s, so 
dose was increased to 10mg on ___. Labetalol was also added. 
 

# COPD: Continued nebulizers.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
- Please increase labetalol dose if patient remains 
hypertensive.
***Patient should NEVER receive an ACE inhibitor or ___
- Apixaban should be 10mg BID through ___, then 5mg BID for 3 
months or longer if indicated.
- F/u with allergy as an outpatient; prior allergy testing 
revealed allergy to shellfish, hazelnut, almonds, peanuts, cow's 
milk but this will need to be confirmed
- Patient will need outpatient sleep study given concern for OSA

___ year old male with PMH COPD (no home O2, last FEV1:35% 
FEV1/FVC:48%) presented to the ED with dyspnea, cough new 3L O2 
requirement found to have LLL pneumonia, complicated by COPD 
exacerbation.
 
# Pneumonia: LLL seen on CXR, most likely community acquired 
pneumonia caused by Strep pneumo, but sputum culture showed only 
comensal respiratory flora. Other causes to consider would be 
MRSA given pt occupation in hospital, but showed marked clinical 
improvement on levofloxacin alone, so was continued. Blood 
cultures sent, were NGTD at time of discharge. Pneumonia likely 
triggered COPD exacerbation as below. 
-Levofloxacin for 10 day course
-F/u blood culture results at PCP visit week following discharge

#COPD exacerbation: Likely triggered by pneumonia as above. 
Patient admitted with 3L O2 requirement, but after two days of 
antibiotic therapy, albuterol nebs and steroid burst was stable 
on room air with ambulatory saturations 94-96%. 
-Slow taper of prednisone burst
-Antibiotics as above

#Documented history of the following issues for which patient 
was stable on home medications: Low back pain (oxycodone and 
oxycontin per narcotics agreement), Hypertension (no 
medications), Depression (mirtazapine, fluoxetine, lorazepam), 
and Lung nodules (no treatment).

#Transitional issues for this patient include following up with 
PCP for blood culture results.

She continued with medical management.  She was taken to the 
operating room on ___ and mitral valve replacement, aortic 
valve replacement and tricuspid valve repair (see op note for 
full details).  She tolerated the procedure well and 
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable 
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. Her gtt included 
Milrinone, dubutaimine, and levo. She had significant ectopy and 
rapid afib (chronic afib at baseline) and was started on 
Amiodarone.  She weaned from sedation,slow to wake,  awoke 
neurologically intact and was extubated on POD 2.  She was 
weaned from inotropic and vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was 
initiated and she was diuresed toward her preoperative weight. 
Coumadin was started for her mechanical valves and chronic 
atrial fibrillation. She remained hemodynamically stable and was 
transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest 
tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.  
She was evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance 
with strength and mobility. Her INR became supratherapeutic 
requiring coumadin to be held. She developed right upper 
abdominal pain in the presence of elevated liver enzymes and 
rising WBC, an ultrasound was obtained which was negative. 
Ciprofloxacin was started for a ? urinary tract infection but 
was dc'd once culture was negative. She was started on Keflex 
for lower sternal drainage. She was also noted to be 
hyponatremic and was started on sodium tabs, they are to 
continue for the next week and she will need to have her sodium 
monitored while recovering at home to help guide therapy.  By 
the time of discharge on POD #9 she was ambulating freely, her 
wound was healing, minimal drainage, no erythemia and pain was 
controlled with oral analgesics.  She was discharged to home in 
good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.

PATIENT SUMMARY
=============================
___ w/ CAD (s/p DES to LAD ___, T2DM, HTN, HLD, DVT/PE (s/p 
IVC filter ___, off AC ___ cystic artery bleed), prior MVA w/ 
hip & femur fractures  (requiring multiple
surgeries w/ residual L foot drop & chronic pain) admitted w/  
new LLE pain and discoloration (no vascular compromise), found 
to have incidental new subsegmental PE (started on warfarin w/  
lovenox bridge).

ACUTE MEDICAL ISSUES
=============================
# LOWER EXTREMITY PAIN & SWELLING: He presented with pain, 
purple discoloration, and coolness of his left foot, which were 
very concerning for limb ischemia. Fortunately, CTA showed 
patent arteries & veins in the lower extremities and pulses 
were intact. Vascular surgery initially managed the patient and 
determined that no surgical intervention was warranted. 
Etiology of his left leg pain & swelling remains unclear, but 
it improved prior to discharge. Of note he had a similar 
episode last year while admitted, which was also evaluated by 
vascular surgery without a definite diagnosis. Pain was 
controlled with standing APAP & Oxycodone for pain. Thought to 
have neuropathic component and improved with initiation of 
Gabapentin.

# SUBSEGMENTAL PE: Patient incidentally found to have 
subsegmental PE on CTA torso. He had DVT & PE in ___, and was 
on Warfarin for many years. Warfarin was stopped when he had a 
spontaneous cystic artery hemorrhage while on ASA, Plavix, and 
Warfarin. The right hepatic artery was embolized at that time. 
The decision was made to anticoagulate given patient 
symptomatic (initially had chest pain and shortness of breath) 
and history of DVT/PEs after discussion of the risks and 
benefits. Initially started initially on a heparin gtt, which 
he tolerated well. He remained hemodynamically stable, and was 
transitioned to warfarin with lovenox bridge. 

Incidental imaging finding (see below in transitional issues) 

CHRONIC ISSUES
=============================
#) HLD: continued atorvastatin
#) CAD: continued aspirin
#) Depression, anxiety: continued alprazolam, citalopram
#) HTN: continued metoprolol, lisinopril
#) h/o osteomyelitis: continued bactrim

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=============================
- Anticoagulation plan: Patient discharged on warfarin with a 
lovenox bridge.  Need to repeat INR on ___, and adjust 
Coumadin accordingly.  Continue lovenox until INR is greater 
than 2 for 2 days.  Could consider referral to hematology for 
further discussion regarding the duration of anticoagulation.
- Pain regimen on discharge: hydrocodone-acetaminophen and 
gabapentin.  Assess pain and adjust pain regimen as needed.
- Incidental imaging finding on CT: ""Small sclerotic focus 
along the inferior endplate of the T5 vertebral body which is 
new as compared to ___ which could be degenerative.  
However, correlation for history of neoplasm, with PSA is 
recommended and if there is clinical concern, bone scan can be 
considered.""

Pt initially had labored breathing and had oxygen saturation 
95-98% on 3L. Imaging (CT scan) was notable only for pleural 
effusion.  Diagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis was performed 
without complications (CXR s/p procedure done). Pleural fluid 
was consistent with transudate and culture of fluid showed no 
growth as of discharge day.  Pt had only moderate relief of SOB 
after procedure. Oxygen by nasal cannula weaned over day of 
discharge and pt appeared to be breathing comfortably with 
saturation in mid-90's.  Pt states that he still feels short of 
breath, but labored breathing no longer present.  On physical 
exam, there are decreased rales bilaterally as compared to exam 
on admission day; breath sounds are now present in the right 
lower lung field (previously absent).

Evaluation of his transudative effusions demonstrated newly 
diagnosis of combined systolic/diastolic congestive heart 
failure and severe mitral regurgitation.  He has been instructed 
to follow-up with PCP and cardiologist.  Even if still in rehab, 
pt should see cardiologist within ___ weeks.  In long term, this 
pt should be started on a beta-blocker.

presented to clinic on ___ with worsening right lower extremity 
pain associated with increasing erythema and drainage. She also 
admits to low grade fevers. She has had difficulty walking due 
to her right lower extremity pain. She was previously on 
antibiotics while at rehab but the antibiotics were discontinued 
at discharge. She denied chills, rigors, chest pain, shortness 
of breath, orthopnea and PND. She was placed on Vancomycin for 
IV antibiotics and the 2 small areas of the  right leg were 
opened and hematoma was evacuated. Her culture showed MIXED 
BACTERIAL FLORA. Her antibiotic therapy was broadened to vanco 
and zosyn. Her wound erythema improved, it continues to drain 
serosanguinous drainage and require bid dressing change with 
packing of tunneled areas. She has remained afebrile and WBC 
stable. PICC line was placed for antibiotic regimen. She has 
continued to progress well. She has remained in sinus rhythm and 
coumadin was discontinued. She was seen by ___ wound care nurse 
and she recommended the following treatment plan for discharge 
to home:
The pt's right medial thigh and popliteal area has 2 openings -
the inferior opening is larger but not a deep. It is approx 0.8
cm in diameter and 3 cm deep. The superior opening is smaller
approx 0.6 cm but tracks proximally at least 16 cm - this is
easily explored with a ___ Fr catheter. The probes ( cotton tip
and metal probe) did not go in as easily and required pt to rest
her leg on bed.
The track with 120 cc of NS with initial small
purulence then quickly turned to red then clear. 
Outside the openings the skin is intact, indurated with lumpy
tissue consistent with resolving hematoma. The skin is without
erythema and pt denies pain. 

Suggest: 
Irrigate superior track with 120 cc NS daily 
Irrigate inferior wound with wound cleanser set to stream
when finished, pat dry
and pack both wounds with ___ inch AMD packing strip( covidien )
cover with dry gauze or sofsorb ( if needed for increased
drainage ) 
secure with Medipore H cloth tape
change daily

The patient was transitioned to Augmentin x7 days at the time of 
discharge.

the patient was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for 
recovery and invasive monitoring. POD 1 found the patient 
extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably. The 
patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable. 
Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed 
toward the preoperative weight. He did have rate controlled 
atrial fibrillation controlled with increased Lopressor and 
Amiodarone. This converted to sinus rhythm and he was in sinus 
rhythm at the time of discharge for over 24 hours. He had 
delirium post op treated with Haldol which cleared by the time 
of discharge. He was transferred to the telemetry floor for 
further recovery. Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued

SUMMARY:
=========
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with a history of HTN, HLD, 
T2DM, CAD s/p missed inferior wall MI, HF borderline EF 
(45-50%), and moderate MR, who presented to BI-M with abdominal 
pain concerning for passed gallstone, course c/b NSTEMI for 
which she is transferred to ___ for cath which found three 
vessel disease. Due to concern for ACS risk, ___ was consulted 
for CABG assessment. Hospital course also notable for 
uncontrolled hypertension. She was discharged with plan to 
return the following week for elective CABG.

ACTIVE MANAGEMENT:
==================
# NSTEMI, type II 
# CAD (3-vessel; CTO RCA, CTO circ, 60% LAD)
# Heart Failure, EF 45%
Uptrending trops to peak of 0.24 without clear EKG changes at 
OSH. Likely that stress of choledocholithiasis unmasked her 
underlying CAD with demand NSTEMI due to collateral 
insufficiency. She was transferred to ___ for further 
cardiology management. Cath notable for no acute occlusion but 
with chronic three vessel disease. Myocardial injury likely due 
to supply-demand mismatch in setting of intra-abdominal 
pathology (see below). Given DM and multivessel disease with 
mildly depressed LVEF, Csurg was consulted and she was 
discharged for planned elective CABG the following week. 
- PRELOAD: continued Lasix 20 mg PO daily daily 
- AFTERLOAD: continue losartan 100 mg PO daily
- NHBK: metoprolol was held (as she was started on labetalol to 
optimize HTN control)

# HTN 
Labile blood pressures initially during the admission, peaking 
up to 190s/90s. She was started on labetalol for additional 
control, requiring that metoprolol be stopped. Amlodipine was 
considered to avoid the TID dosing of labetalol and allow 
restarting of metoprolol, though she noted previous intolerance 
(gum hyperplasia) to it. She was concerned about her HR being 
elevated, though telemetry showed that her HR was stable in 
___ throughout the admission.

# Anxiety
Expressed significant affects on her mood in regards to these 
new developments for her health. Social work consult for coping. 
She required Ativan 0.5mg PO once which had good effect and did 
not require any more after.

# Transaminitis
# Abdominal pain, c/f
# Choledocholithiasis with passed stone
Initially presented to OSH with abdominal pain 2 hours after 
dinner, iso of likely choledocholithiasis, found to have 
elevated LFTs up to 1000s. OSH CT A/P showed gallbladder wall 
edema and mucosal enhancement, bilateral perinephric soft tissue 
stranding (subsequent renal U/S wnl, urine with microalbuminuria 
and glycosuria but otherwise normal),and distal rectal wall 
thickening. LFTs improved without intervention. Likely c/w 
passed gallstone. Would benefit for outpatient evaluation of

operative report for further details. He received cefazolin for 
perioperative antibiotics and was transferred to the intensive 
care unit for post operative management. That evening he was 
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact, and was 
extubated without complications. On post operative day one he 
was started on beta blockers and diuretics. He continued to do 
well and was transferred to the floor. That evening he developed 
atrial fibrillation and was treated with intravenous Lopressor 
and amiodarone. He was then placed on amiodarone drip due to 
persistent atrial fibrillation. He continued in atrial 
fibrillation and received one bolus of diltiazem with no 
response, beta blockers were continued to be increased and on 
post operative day two he converted to normal sinus rhythm. His 
Foley was removed and he was able to void post removal but then 
had high residual and it was reinserted. He continued with the 
Foley until post operative day four, at which time it was 
removed and he had no further difficulties. His chest tubes and 
wires were removed per protocol. He had further episodes of 
atrial fibrillation that were treated with amiodarone and 
titrating up beta blockers, and he was started on Coumadin for

congestion, cough, and SOB. Her daughter reports that she has 
been having fevers at home, up to 101.3F for the past 2 days. 
She called her PCP ___ ___, and was prescribed cefpodoxime, of 
which she has taken 1 dose. The patient's daughter states that 
the patient has not been eating or drinking for the past day due 
to her sore throat and cough. The cough is productive of 
white/clear sputum. Pt reports that she does not have COPD and 
is a never smoker. She is prescribed inhalers, but has never 
needed to take them. She is not on O2 at home. She denies chest 
pain, nausea, palpitations, weakness, confusion, shaking chills. 


Upon arrival to the ED, pt was noted to have diffuse rhonchi. A 
wbc of 7.5, a proBNP of 1607, a lactate of 1.1, creatinine: 1.2, 
BUN of 24 and was negative for Flu A/B. A CXR was done that 
showed patchy airspace opacities within the lower lobes 
bilaterally, compatible with infection vs. pneumonia. Due to her 
oxygen requirement she was transferred to the ICU for closer 
monitoring, as she was satting 91% on 6LNC.

Patient's condition improved with and she was weaned to room 
air. She ambulated without supplemental oxygen and maintained 
adequate oxygen saturation > 94%. 
Patient was treated with cephalosporin and doxycycline to 
complete 7 day course. She was started on oral steroid due to 
bronchospasm and had improvement within 24 hours of discharge. 
Odynophagia improved. She was discharged with benzonatate for 
cough. Patient had some dysphagia, but no restrictions 
recommended by swallow evaluation. Patient's pulmonary reserve 
may be lessened in the setting of underlying obstructive lung 
pathology. She is discharged on home inhaler regimen of 
umeclidinium and budesonide-formeterol. Presentation less likely 
represented acute heart failure exacerbation, though BNP was 
elevated there was no clear evidence of pulmonary edema on 
imaging. It is possible this represented flash pulmonary edema 
responding to dose of Lasix. TTE can be pursued as an 
outpatient. 

Prerenal azotemia (___) in the setting of acute illness improved 
with above therapy and creatinine returned to baseline CKD. 

Given acute illness hydralazine is held on discharge, but

not bear this out. Clinically improved. DCed to rehab with 
outpatient follow up with vascular surgery to further evaluate 
mesenteric blood flow.  
.  
# Abdominal pain: No imaging or laboratory abnormalities. No 
elevations in lactate and tolerating POs. Does not seem 
consistent with mesenteric ischemia. Could be mesenteric angina. 
Could represent IMI but CEs negative and no CP. Seems as much 
related to heparin injections in abd wall as true belly pain. 
LFT and lipase WNL. Tolerating POs. Continued PPI and 
simethicone. Possible mesentric angina. Acute mesenteric 
ischemia unlikely given CTA of abdomen on admission. Vascular 
surgery following. Plan is for mesenteric angio studies as an 
outpatient.
.  
# Delirium and dementia: Chronic issue, complicated by illness 
and hospitalization. Avoided anticholinergic and altering 
medications. Received Tylenol for pain with good effect. B12 
WNL. UA negative. CXR negative for PNA. Stool negative for 
Cdiff. TSH 8.3, so hypothyroidism is a possibly compicating 
factor and even etiologic to her general decline but T4 WNL. CT 
and Hx consistend with sinusitis. Treating as below. Depression 
and coping with her CVA seem to be part of her present illness. 
Given this, starting citalopram 20 mg PO daily.   
.  
# Sinusitis: Suspected based on Pt complaints of difficulty 
breathing through her nose and CT finding of new air fluid level 
in sinus. Started Flonase daily. 
.  
# Diarrhea: Etiology unclear. Subjective complaint only as only 
2BM recorded daily. Cdiff negative x 3. 
.  
# Hypothyroidism: On home regimen levothyroxine 50mcg QOD 
alterating with 75mcg QOD. TSH 8.3 as above but fT4 1.4, WNL. 
Continue home regimen of levothyroxine.   
.  
# Cough: Etiology unclear. No evidence of PNA or pulmonary 
edema. Could be ___ sinsusitis with post nasal drip. On 
Guaifenesin-Dextromethorphan 5 mL PO Q6H:PRN. Trating sinsusitis 
as above.   
.

Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o woman with history of 3vCAD s/p recent 
MI without revascularization, MDS, HTN, HLD, CKD, chronic 
thrombocytopenia thought to be due to evolving MDS, now 
presenting with acute on chronic kidney disease, hyperglycemia 
in setting of steroid use, worsening chronic anemia, and chronic 
thrombocytopenia. 
 
# 3vCAD s/p recent MI without PCI ___ thrombocytopenia
# Exertional dyspnea: Improved 
# Bradycardia: Resolved 
# HFpEF: Stable, euvolemic
# HTN: Normotensive
Ms. ___ presented following recent MI in ___, with 
shortness of breath and no antiplatelet agents on board due to 
her thrombocytopenia. This admission, cardiology was consulted 
for optimization of CAD medical management, particularly given 
concern that a cardiorenal process may have contributed to her 
___ on presentation. TTE performed ___ to evaluate for infective 
endocarditis showed LVEF 69% and left atrial volume severely 
increased. In consultation with hematology, she was started on a 
baby aspirin, dual antiplatelet therapy was not pursued given 
her thrombocytopenia. Her Losartan and Lasix were held given her 
___. Standing weights remained stable off furosemide and 
spironolactone throughout her admission. Metoprolol XL was 
down-titrated from home dose of 100mg daily due to bradycardia. 
She was ultimately started on isosorbide dinitrate 20mg PO TID 
and discharged on metoprolol XL 50 mg QD, with good symptomatic 
response. IV fluids were avoided to maintain euvolemia. By time 
of discharge, she was euvolemic on exam, with resolved chest 
pain and improved exercise tolerance. 
Discharge weight: 92.5 kg
Discharge creatinine: 1.6
Diuretics: held on discharge

# Hyperglycemia: Improved
Blood glucose was 600 on admission. Given no personal history of 
diabetes and prior history of insulin requirement for 
steroid-induced hyperglycemia, favored steroid-induced 
hyperglycemia from dexamethasone as etiology. She was continued 
on glargine and sliding scale insulin throughout the admission. 
Dexamethasone was stopped ___, resulting in resolution of 
hyperglycemia, confirming the diagnosis. Glargine and sliding 
scale insulin were stopped ___ given resolution of 
hyperglycemia. 
 
# Acute on chronic CKD: Stable 
Unclear baseline Cr, in ___ system 1.1-1.4, peak 1.8 on 
admission, decreased and stable at 1.5, 1.6 upon discharge. 
Likely secondary to hypovolemia in setting of hyperglycemia with 
osmotic diuresis, possibly with prior component of cardiorenal 
syndrome. Improved with initial volume repletion and medical 
optimization of cardiac medications. 

# Leukocytosis 
# Viridans strep on blood culture
No clear signs or symptoms of infection on admission, although 
she did endorse morning fatigue, shortness of breath since her 
recent MI, and at least one month of mild epigastric soreness. 
Ms. ___ had leukocytosis on admission, with WBC on 19.9. 
Reaction to recent steroid course was considered most likely 
etiology, but infectious work-up was pursued given concern for 
infection-associated mortality risk in patients with MDS. 
___, one blood culture grew GPCs, for which vancomycin was 
empirically started ___, later resulted as Strep viridans. 
Further work-up was pursued in consultation with Infectious 
Disease to exclude a gastrointestinal source given 1 month of 
abdominal pain and history of diverticulitis, with an 
unrevealing CT abdomen obtained ___. TTE was obtained ___ to 
exclude infective endocarditis given persistent shortness of 
breath. TTE was negative for valvular vegetations and there were 
no stigmata of IE on exam, so TEE was not pursued given low 
clinical suspicion. By ___, her leukocytosis had improved to 
17.2, CRP was normal, and she remained afebrile, hemodynamically 
stable, and clinically well. Therefore, in consultation with 
Infectious Diseases, suspect  Viridans strep spp on cultures was 
a likely contaminant and vancomycin was discontinued on ___. A 
Strep pneumo urine antigen and final blood cultures were still 
pending at time of discharge.  
 
CHRONIC ISSUES
===============
# Epigastric abdominal pain: Stable
Attributed to possible GERD / PUD given history of high dose 
steroids, low suspicion for ischemia. CT abdomen ___ was 
unrevealing and abdominal exams were reassuring. Home PPI was 
continued.
 
# Normocytic normochromic anemia: Stable 
Patient with mild chronic anemia thought to be due to possible 
evolving MDS, now with Hgb around 9 g/dL (down from 11 g/dL in 
___. GI bleeding source was considered given 
epigastric pain, but less likely given H&H stability and normal 
CT abdomen. AHA and hemolysis were excluded. In consultation 
with hematology, found to be most consistent with evolving MDS, 
potentially with some contribution from anemia of inflammation. 
She will follow up as outpatient with Hematology for 
consideration of a bone marrow biopsy.
 
# Chronic thrombocytopenia: Stable
Followed by hematology here and likely due evolving MDS. 
___. Decadron burst completed ___. Inpatient Hematology 
recommended outpatient bone marrow biopsy on close follow up. 
She will follow up as outpatient with Hematology for 
consideration of a bone marrow biopsy.
 
# HLD: Continued home statin 
 
# Hypothyroidism:  TSH 0.06, normal free T4 at 1.2. Continued 
home levothyroxine. 
 
# Primary hyperparathyroidism: Mildly elevated PTH and 
high-normal calcium, consistent with mild primary 
hyperparathyroidism.

___ year-old female with CAD s/p triple CABG (___, ___, DMII, 
HTN and cirrhosis attributed to steatohepatitis with recurrent 
ascites reguiring frequent therapeutic paracenteses. Patient 
presents with leaking umbilical hernia.  
.  
#. RECURRENT ASCITES/UMBILICAL HERNIA: Patient presented in no 
respiratory distress, confusion, or abdominal pain with only 
low-grade fevers which decreases suspicion for SBP. Serum 
lactate was within normal limits.  Likely umbilical hernia 
draining through small ulceration in skin secondary to chronic 
irritation. Paracentesis every 2 to 3 weeks are controlling her 
fluid. She should get 5 to 6 g of albumin for each liter removed 
after her parasentesis.  The transplant/surgery team assessed 
the patient for umbilical hernia repair and she was transferred

Mr. ___ was ___ transferred to ___ after cardiac cath 
at ___ revealed severe left main disease. He was brought 
to the CVICU where he was medically managed and underwent 
appropriate pre-op work-up. Later this day he was brought to the 
operating room where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft 
x 4 (Left internal Mammary artery grafted to Left anterior 
descending/saphenous vein grafted to Ramus/Obtuse 
Marginal/Posterior descending artery). Preinduction placement of 
an IABP was done. Cross clamp time= 57 minutes. Cardiopulmonary 
Bypass time= 68 minutes. Please see operative report for 
surgical details. Following surgery he was transferred to the 
CVICU for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours he was weaned 
from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. IABP 
was removed on post-op day one. Beta-blocker/Statin/aspirin/and 
diuresis was initiated. He continued to progress and was 
transferred to the telemetry floor for further monitoring. Chest 
tubes were removed on post-op day two. Chest x-ray after removal 
revealed large right sided pneumothorax. Right-sided chest tube 
was immediately placed. Chest tube removed with small residual 
PTX and asymptomatic. Pacing wires removed per protocol.

The following issues were addressed at this admission:

# Elevated troponins and coronary artery disease. The patient 
underwent cardiac catheterization showing diffuse disease but no 
clear point for intervention (see cath report, above). Given her 
multiple intercurrent illnesses and no history of chest pain, 
this was felt to be most likely a demand ischemic event. at 
discharge, the patient stated that she would prefer to follow up 
with her primary care doctor than to see a separate 
cardiologist. Given her severe prognosis per her recent 
onocology notes, this seems a reasonable decision. However, 
contact information for Dr. ___ was provided to the patient 
in the event that she or her PCP feel that she would benefit 
from independent cardiology follow up.

# Flu-like symptoms. The patient was afebrile but with continued 
cough. She had been started on a course of IV moxifloxacin at 
the OSH, and was switched to levofloxacin here (moxi not on our 
formulary). At discharge, antibiotics were discontinued as she 
had no evidence of penumonia; notes from OSH did not specify 
intended treatment duration, but it was believed that the 
antibiotics were prescribed to treat a possbile COPD flare.

# Non-small cell lung cancer. Per most recent oncology note (Dr. 
___, patient's disease is progressing despite optimal 
medical management. She is still doing sufficiently well to live 
independently, but hospice may be in her future. She has decided 
against further chemotherapy. She was continued on oxygen as 
needed throughout this admission, as well as on albuterol and 
Advair and guaifenisen for cough. Smoking cessation counseling 
was again provided to patient, who reportedly continued to smoke 
several cigarettes per day.

# Possible COPD flare. Symptoms were difficult to distinguish 
from those caused by underlying lung cancer. Antibiotics were 
continued throughout her hospital stay but discontinued at 
discharge. Likewise, she arrived from the OSH on 60 mg IV 
solumedrol BID without indication of intended treatment course 
or taper plan. She was converted to 40 mg PO prednisone BID at 
discharge with plans to taper by 10 mg Q 3 days. as above, she 
was maintained on oxygen as needed throughout this admission, as 
well as on albuterol and Advair and guaifenisen for cough.

# Hyperglycemia. Patient stated she has no history of diabetes, 
but was told she had hyperglycemia since initiating course of 
steroids. HbA1c at OSH was 5.6. She was placed on fingersticks 
QID which ranged from low 100s to low 200s. As HbA1c was within 
normal limits and there was a plan for steroid taper, she was 
not discharged on any medications to control hyperglycemia. 

# Hypothyroidism. She had recently been noted to have slightly 
decreased TSH but normal free T4 and her levothyroxine dosing 
had been decreased from 110 mcg to 100 mcg daily. She was 
continued on 100 mcg daily during this admission and discharged 
on that dose.

# Hypertension. The patient's blood pressures were 
well-controlled during this admission on atenolol, lisinopril, 
HCTZ, spironolactone.

# Possible systolic CHF. There was no official echo report 
included in the OSH paperwork, but per notes from recent echo 
her LV EF is 35-40% and her BNP was elevated to 780. She did not 
appear clinically volume overloaded, although her lung exam was 
somewhat poor (this was likely her baseline, secondary to her 
lung cancer).

# Lupus nephritis
Creatinine rose to 6 with hyperkalemia, elevated phosphorus, a 
metabolic acidosis, and elevated BUN. Worsening renal function 
thought to be due to lupus nephritis flair and noncompliance 
with immunosuppressive therapy. Patient was started on IV methyl 
pred (x3 days) and mycophenelate on admission and transitioned 
to PO prednisone on ___. Cr continued to uptrending to 6.0 (___) 
during admission and eventually stabilized to 5.9. No emergent 
indication for dialysis throughout admission.

# Chest pain 
Chest pain thought to be due to SLE related pericarditis (pain 
improved with leaning forward). Previously treated w/NSIADs. 
Symptoms resolved within 1 day of admission. Low suspicion of MI 
throughout admission given negative troponins and reassuring 
EKGs. TTE demonstrated ventricular hypertrophy and small 
pericardial effusion. Colchicine held given resolving symptoms 
and underlying leukopenia. NSAIDS were held iso kidney injury. 

# Hypertension 
BPs 180/100s on admission thought to be chronic due to renal 
failure and volume overload. Patient remained asymptomatic with 
no mental status changes. Patient started on labetalol and dose 
uptitrated to 600mg TID. She was also started on amlodipine and 
torsemide. 

# Hyperkalemia 
Thought to be secondary to worsening renal failure, improved 
with insulin/dextrose and IV lasix. EKGs throughout admission 
were all reassuring without peaked T waves or ST 
elevations/depressions. 

# Volume overload 
Patient appeared fluid overloaded on admission thought to be due 
to worsening renal failure. Patient was given IV Lasix 
intermittently then transitioned to torsemide.

# Normocytic anemia 
Hgb 6.4 on admission. Thought to be acute on chronic normocytic 
iron deficiency. Iron deficiency likely due to vaginal bleeding 
with underlying chronic kidney disease. No clinical concern for 
significant bleeding. Patient was transfused with 1 unit pRBC on 
___ and ___. Hgb stable, 8.4 on discharge. 

# Leukopenia 
WBC 3.0 on admission thought to be related to SLE. Prior viral

The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room with the Trauma team on ___ 
for right hip closed reduction and aspiration.  He was then 
transferred from the ___ to the ___ for a right 
hip revision (acetabulum only) on ___. Please see 
separately dictated operative reports for details. The surgeries 
wer uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the procedures well. 
Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:
POD #1, creatinine was elevated to 1.6. Torsemide was held. 
Patient encouraged PO fluid intake. Repeat Cr in the afternoon 
was 1.8. Patient was started on IV continuous fluids at 100ml/hr 
for a total of 1 liter. Aspiration cultures showed NGTD.
POD #2, Cr was 1.3 (baseline).  Hct 28.9.
POD #3, Cr was 1.2. Hct 30.6. A Prevena dressing was placed to 
be worn until his follow-up appointment.  Since his creatinine 
was stable, we will resume his home medications after discharge. 
 ___ will check labs early next week to ensure his creatinine 
remains stable (results to be faxed to PCP).  At time of 
discharge, his cultures were still no growth to date.  

Otherwise, pain was controlled with a combination of IV and oral 
pain medications.  The patient received one dose of Lovenox 
after the hip reduction, then was placed on Xarelto for DVT 
prophylaxis starting on the morning of POD#1 after his hip 
revision.  The foley was removed post-operatively and the 
patient was voiding independently thereafter. The surgical 
dressing was changed on POD#2 and the dressing was found to be 
saturated. This continued until POD#3, so a Prevana vac was 
placed for patient to wear until his follow-up appointment. The 
patient was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs were checked 
throughout the hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the 
time of discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and 
feeling well.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs. 
 The patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately 
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was 
neurovascularly intact. 

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity with anterior and posterior 
hip precautions.  Knee immobilizer while in bed (not needed with

Patient had episode of brief confusion this AM. Per prior 
medical records, patient can sometimes be confused. DDx includes 
toxic-metabolic process in setting of renal dysfunction, 
infectious process, or primary neurogenic process among others. 
Latter unlikely given negative head CT and non-focal neuro exam. 
Favor metabolic encephalopathy. On admission, patient AAOx3. His 
mental status remained intact for the remainder of the 
hospitalization.

# Leukocytosis/HCAP-
Patient presented with leukocytosis to 16.6 with neutrophilia on 
differential. He was hemodynamically stable, afebrile, and 
appeared to be perfusing well in the ICU. No adrenergic state or 
recent steroids to explain elevated white count. There was 
concern for infectious etiology given cough and evidence of PNA 
with HCAP risk and initially ? cholecystitis in setting of 
cholestatic LFTs (However, HIDA-limited study returned negative 
and abdominal ultrasound showed cholelithiasis not 
cholecystitis. Lactate was initially elevated at 2.7 initially 
at ___ s/p IVF with admission lactate 1.3. Initially, he was 
treated with broad spectrum antibiotics including aztreonam, 
flagyl, and vancomycin for both pulmonary and GI process. 
Aztreonam was later switched to ciprofloxacin. The clinical 
picture overall was consistent with HCAP but not acute 
cholecystitis as pt did not have any abdominal pain. He 
clinically improved and was transferred to the floor on ___. He 
spiked a temperature to 100.9 with leukocytosis to 20K. 
Ciprofloxacin was switched to cefepime to optimize gram negative 
coverage. He defervesced, leukocytosis improved, and oxygen was 
weaned to room air for which he remained. Final antibiotic 
regimen is IV vanco/cefepime/flagyl x8 total days. Vanco and 
flagyl to end on ___ and cefepime to end on ___. PICC line was 
placed and can be removed after antibiotic course is complete.
.
# Transaminitis
He has had elevated LFTs in past thought to be drug-induced from 
amiodarone and atorvastatin (which were held) in outpatient 
setting. Pattern appeared to be both hepatocellular and 
cholestatic concerning for aforementioned gallbladder process 
with uncharacterized liver disease. Hepatitis viral serologies 
were sent and were negative. HIDA scan was limited but, 
unremarkable. RUQ US with doppler was negative. Off the statin, 
the transaminases improved, and this was thought to be the most 
likely etiology. Statin was not resumed during admission, but 
this can be considered after further outpatient monitoring 
especially given recent stent placement. Pt did not have any 
abdominal pain while on the medical floor.
.
# Acute renal failure on CKD. New baseline appears to be ~2.3. 
Range was 2.3-2.7 during admission.Attributed to increased lasix 
dosage (80mg BID from 40mg BID) over past few weeks as well as 
poor PO intake. FeUREA on admission 34%, also consistent with 
pre-renal process. Recently, pt had AIN from nafcillin and had 
to be temporarily dialyzed. He also received and completed a 
course of prednisone therapy prior to admission. Cr ranged from 
2.3-2.7 during admission and was 2.3 on day of discharge. Pt 
should have his creatinine monitored daily while on antibiotic 
therapy including vanco and cefepime. Of note, the renal team 
monitored the patient closely during admission. His lasix was

# Healthcare Associated Pneumonia: Patient was recently 
discharged from the hospital, and initial chest radiography 
concerning for pneumonia. Given constellation of findings, 
started on empiric coverage for HCAP with vancomycin and zosyn. 
Patient also found to have neutropenia. Patient had sputum 
cultured contaminated with respiratory flora, blood cultures 
were negative. Given neutropenia, other etiologies including CMV 
were tested however negative. PJP unlikely in the setting of 
taking PJP prophylaxis, however respiratory sputum cultures also 
negative for this as well. He also underwent RUQ ultrasound 
which was negative for change. For continued IV antibiotics 
given neutropenia and HCAP, patient had PICC line placed to 
continue treatment course. On D#4 of antibiotics, patient had 
repeat chest imaging which did show improvement, and therefore 
thought not to represent MRSA type infection, and therefore 
continued on zosyn for monotherapy. Patient also had normal 
ambulatory o2 sat. Respiratory viral studies negative as well, 
and therefore to finish course as outpatient x 10 days (last 
___. 
.
# Neutropenia: Mild neutropenia, most likely in the setting of 
underlying infection and marrow suppression from 
immunosuppressive regimen. Patient's MMF was held during 
hospital stay, and CMV studies performed given marrow 
suppression which were negative. Patient was given G-CSF on ___ 
with relative improvement. Outpatient lab work to follow upon 
discharge.

# ___: Found to have relative ___, and with lack of fluid 
responsiveness, and FeNa calculated at 1.7%, thought not to be 
pre-renal. Patient was not hypotensive during hospital stay to 
predispose to ATN, tacrolimus levels not elevated to suggest 
toxicity, and therefore this was monitored. Urine sample showed 
few hyaline casts and granular casts, and renal ultrasound 
without hydronephrosis bilaterally. Therefore, diuretics were 
held until outpatient follow up. Outpatient lab work to follow 
upon discharge.

# Hypertension: Patient was continued on home regimen without 
any episodes of hyper or hypotension. 
. 
# Diabetes Mellitus type II: Patient was found to be 
hypoglycemic in the setting of his infection, and takes insulin 
at home. Patient's insulin sliding scale was going to be changed 
to reflect marked morning hypoglycemia (FSG ___ in AM only, and 
hyperglycemic throughout daytime). However, patient disagreed 
with this plan as has been doing this for several years, and 
discussion of risks/benefits and alternatives with respect to 
fasting sugars, agreed to long-acting insulin at bedtime, with 
reduced dose, and short acting insulin with meals for coverage. 
Patient set up with endocrinologist for follow up of blood 
sugars and management as outpatient. 
. 
# Chronic Back Pain: In review of outside records, patient has 
compression fractures, and continue to see orthopedics for this. 
For pain regimen, patient was continued on home doses of

unclear if patient truly drinks chronicly and is at risk for 
withdrawel. Per discussion with patient, states that currently 
binges for ___ days and then stops drinking for extended periods 
of time. Currently scoring <10. Also, if last drink ___, 
approaching 72 hour window for detox. 

# Anxiety - patient with apparent hx of anxiety which appears to 
be exacerbated when he withdraws from EtOH. Does not follow with 
psychiatrist. Treated withdrawel which improved symptoms. 
Encouraged f/u with psychiatrist.

# Arm ___ tingling - Patient has dx of 
essential tremor for which he was prescribed propranolol. No 
longer taking. However, review of chart shows multiple 
admissions for numbness/tingling which appears to resolve with 
resolution of his anxiety and benzos. Physyical exam reassuring 
with normal strength, sensation. Calcium WNL. Must also consider 
EtOH neuropathy, but MCV WNL. Symptomaticlly improved this 
admission.
 
#  Elevated Lactate - likely due to dehydration. No obvious 
source of infection. Possible to have chronic elevations in 
alcoholics. Considered ethylene gylcol intoxication given 
patient's elevated serum osmolality, however no osmolal gap when 
corrected for serum EtOH. Patient denied ingestion other than 
EtOH. Received 1g CTX in ED for unclear infection but was 
without symptoms of infection for duration of hospitalization. 
After some IVF on medicine floor, trended down to 1.3. Resolved.

Ms. ___ is a ___ yo woman ___ significant for CAD s/p CABG 
and PCI, dCHF (EF 40-45% in ___, Polymyalgia Rheumatica, DMII, 
depression, hypothyroidism who initially presented with chest 
pain and admitted for vertigo. 

Chest pain:  patient reported intermittent non-exertional chest 
pain over site of PPM. In the ED, PPM was evaluated by EP and 
found to be without issue. EKG was unchanged and troponin x 2. 
She had no more chest pain during her hospitalization. We 
decided not to perform a stress test given the atypical nature 
of her symptoms. She will follow with her cardiologist next 
month. 

Vertigo:  she reported symptoms were similar to her symptoms one 
year prior (patient was admitted for vertigo in ___. On 
arrival to the medicine floor she had unsteady gait. Cerebellar 
exam was normal and she had no other new focal deficits on neuro 
exam. Of note, she has chronic right sided weakness from prior 
stroke. ___ did reproduce her symptoms and Epley 
maneuver made her feel better.  Patient felt better on HD2 and 
was discharge home with home ___.  

Chronic Issues: 

CAD: S/p CABG and PCI, s/p dual chamber pacemaker. Pacemaker was 
evaluated in the ED and working properly. 
- Continued home medications: carvedilol, clopidogrel, aspirin, 
rosuvastatin. Of note patient reported she was only taking 25 mg 
carvedilol per day so gave her 12.5 mg BID and recommended this 
dose at discharge.
- Home isosorbide mononitrate divided 15 mg BID.

# Encephalopathy: On admission, patient with known hypoglycemic 
coma with delayed response to normalization. Unclear if patient 
had true seizure in ED, however EEG obtained which showed no 
seizure activity. Was intubated for airway protection in ED but 
extubated on hospital day 2 without complications. 
Most likely due to sequelae of severe hypoglycemia and possible 
resultant seizure, in the setting of heavy ETOH use, continued 
use of humalog, and poor PO intake. Subsequently rapidly 
improved back to baseline. Also started empirically on 
phenobarbital for alcohol withdrawal and 3 days of IV thiamine. 
TSH, AM cortisol wnl. Neurology did not feel that MRI was 
clinically indicated. She will have home OT.

# Diarrhea: Likely antibiotic associated (received empiric 
antibiotics briefly in the MICU). Cliff neg. Subsequently 
resolved. 

# Depression: Pt endorsed active depression but denied 
suicidality, though she does not recall the events leading up to 
her admission. More likely this reflected insulin administration 
in the setting of poor PO intake and heavy ETOH use. Her ETOH 
use is likely ___ for untreated depression. SW was 
consulted. She was continued on home venlafaxine and mirtazapine 
(restarted at discharge). Suggest outpatient dual diagnosis 
therapy. Pt will have home ___ with SW.

# DMI:  Brittle with multiple admissions for hyperglycemia and 
DKA, though this admission due to severe hypoglycemia. Follows 
with ___. Acidosis was ___, no e/o DKA. Home regimen of 
75/25 BID humalog felt to be unsafe in the setting of ETOH 
abuse, intermittent poor PO intake. Switched to lantus humalog 
sliding scale. DM educator did teaching and pt was given new 
supplies. ___ c/w DMI. She will f/u with ___. ___ will 
cont teaching at home.

# ___ anion acidosis: Likely due to losses from diarrhea, as 
distal RTA would be unlikely to ___ so quickly. 
Resolved prior to admission.

# ETOH: Pt reports long standing heavy abuse, likely source of 
recurrent hospitalizations. Received phenobarb taper for detox, 
though never demonstrated overt signs of withdrawal. Started on 
Thiamine, folate, MVI, magnesium. SW was consulted, given 
contact info for AA and SOAP program at ___. SW will see via 
___ at home. Suggest outpatient dual diagnosis therapy followup. 
Consideration can be made for naltrexone.

# HTN: Restarted home lisinopril at reduced 10 mg dose. 
Continued home metoprolol, converted to XL to help with 
adherence.

# Anemia: Likely iron deficient in the setting of menstruation. 
Tsat<10%. Started ferritin 325 mg daily with bowel regimen. 
Consider outpt GYN eval.

- Endorsed depression without SI. This probably is contributing 
to ongoing alcohol use. Should be reconnected with psychiatry 
for dual diagnosis treatment. Consideration can be made for 
naltrexone.
- Her insulin regimen has been adjusted by ___ (lantus + 
humalog sliding scale)
- She was noted to be anemic in the setting of a heavy period

# Encephalopathy: On admission to the ICU, the patient was 
unresponsive to verbal stimuli and unable to follow commands. 
However, the patient appeared to be responding to painful 
stimuli. Differential diagnosis included neuroglycopenic effects 
of hypoglycemia, infectious etiology (encephalitis), toxic 
metabolic encephalopathy, and seizure disorder. The patient had 
a relative leukocytosis WBC 7.9 (previous WBC ___ and given the 
patient's extensive infectious history, was initially broadly 
covered with Vancomycin and Zosyn. Toxic screen was negative. An 
OSH noncontrast head CT was did not demonstrate any acute 
intracranial processes. The patient's hypoglycemia was treated 
as below. The patient had a bedside EEG was consistent with 
toxic metabolic encephalitis. Repeat mental status exams showed 
no improvement. Patient did not respond to commands to make 
purposeful movements. Patient was given lactulose, which did not 
improve his mental status. While on the medical floor, the 
patient intermittently would respond to verbal stimuli with head 
nods. 

# Hypoglycemia: Patient was persistently hypoglycemic ___ at 
LTAC despite dextrose boluses and D10 drip. Per ___ providers, 
the patient was continued on tube feeds. The patient's blood 
sugars were reportedly within normal limits until one day prior 
to admission. An AM cortisol was within normal limits. Endocrine 
was consulted and recommended checking C-peptide and insulin if 
he became hypoglycemic. However, he did not have any additional 
hypoglycemic episodes. Patient's tube feeds were eventually 
restarted, and his D10 was weaned off. Patient eventually became 
increasingly hyperglycemic and required insulin (per family 
request this was continued along with comfort care measures).

# Respiratory Support: Patient is s/p tracheostomy and at 
baseline is mechanically ventilated in the evening. The patient 
was continued on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. His 
mechanical ventilation was eventually weaned, and his oxygen 
saturation was well maintained on a trach mask. He is 
intermittently suctioned for comfort. 

# Failure to Thrive/Nutrition: The patient has a long standing 
history of malnutrition and failure to thrive of unclear 
etiology. In the ICU, the patient was continued on tube feeds 
and Creon. The tube feeds were continued upon transition to 
comfort focused care per family wishes.

# Bilateral Exposure Keropathy: During the patient's last ICU 
admission, the patient's bilateral exposure keropathy was 
complicated by hypophyon requiring anterior chamber washout and 
lateral tarsorraphies. During this ICU admission, the patient's 
eye drops (Polytrim (polymyxin B sulf-trimethoprim) 10,000 unit- 
1 mg/mL ophthalmic QID) were continued. The patient outpatient 
Ophthalmologist, Dr. ___, was contacted and recommended no 
additional interventions.

___ year-old man with a complicated PMH including type I DM c/b 
frequent infections including Fournier's gangrene and 
osteomyelitis, hidradenitis, morbid obesity, severe HTN, 
depression, multiple suicide attempts, including prior 
acetaminophen overdose ___, now admitted for acetaminophen 
overdose.  

# Acetaminophen overdose: On discharge his Tylenol level was 
undetectable and his LFT's were within normal limits. He 
completed the ___ 21 hour protocol. He was asymptomatic from the 
standpoint of this ingestion, and he continued to deny that it 
was a suicide attempt. He was evaluated by psychiatry, who did 
not feel as though he was a suicide risk on this admission. 

# S/P assault, throat and back pain: He reported improvement in 
his left upper extremity strength, which he had initially noted 
to be decreased after the assault. MRI of the C-spine and 
T-spine did not demonstrate any evidence of cord compression or 
other structural abnormality to account for these symptoms. 
Additionally, he reported persistent change in his voice and 
difficulty swallowing liquids after being attacked and struck on 
his neck. The patient was not noted by staff to be aspirating 
liquids or solids during his stay. The patient remained 
concerned over the presence of a lumbar vertebral fracture. We 
offered to evaluate the lumbar spine with plain films, given his 
history of chronic low back pain exacerbated in the setting of 
recent assault, but he declined as he felt the team would not 
change their opinions. Of note, he became agitated and 
aggressive towards staff when we refused to provide a 
prescription for narcotic pain medication upon discharge. 

# Drug seeking behavior
This decision to attempt to avoid narcotic medications was aided 
by discussion with his PCP (Dr. ___ at ___ 
___) who reported that he had previously sought out 
additional narcotic pain medications following the amputation of 
his toe on the right foot (___). She reports that he 
untruthfully claimed to have not been given any pain medication 
upon discharge following this surgery in ___, and so she 
prescribed a small number of narcotic pain pills. She later 
received a call from his pharmacy, stating that he had in fact 
received narcotics from his surgeon, and had attempted to fill 
her prescription as well. This account, coupled with his 
behavior surrounding this issue, raised concerns for 
drug-seeking behavior on this admission. Additionally, he admits 
to using 3+ different pharmacies, and has multiple PCP's who he 
has seen over the last year. During the admission process, in 
attempting to reconcile his home medications, we received 
multiple very different lists of current medications from the 
patient, his multiple pharmacies, and his PCP of record, Dr. 
___. As a result, it was very difficult to reconcile his 
medications, and the final list is correct to the best of our 
knowledge. He was discharged with a prescription for Ultram for 
control of back pain s/p assault. 

# Hypertension: Well controlled on this admission. He was 
continued on his home regimen of labetalol. 

# HLD: Stable. Restarted home regimen on discharge. 
 
# Diabetes: Blood glucose was well controlled on this admission. 
He was restarted on his home insulin regimen upon discharge.

with associated fevers - found to have positive monospot with 
suspected secondary bacterial tonsillitis and acute 
transaminitis.

Acute mono with severe pharyngitis, concern for secondary 
bacterial tonsillitis without abscess: Pt underwent CT neck in 
the ED that was reassuring without retropharyngeal abscess.  
Throat culture was negative for group A Strep and G/C negative.  
Pt was seen by ENT due to concern for epiglottitis and 
epiglottis appeared normal on direct laryngoscopy.  ENT 
recommended steroids to help with severe pharyngitis and 
inability to tolerate po due to severe throat pain. Exam was 
notable for ""kissing tonsils"" with yellow exudate.  Pt was 
treated with decadron, unasyn, Toradol, Tylenol and IVF.  
Symptoms improved and pt was tolerating a regular diet by the 
time of discharge.  Pt was transitioned to oral Amoxicillin and 
a rapid prednisone taper with plan for PCP follow up on ___.

Transaminitis, likely secondary to acute EBV/Mono: Pt admitted 
to drinking alcohol on the day PTA that was followed by 
worsening sore throat and fevers.  Suspect the transaminitis was 
secondary to mono though etoh injury may have contributed.  
Acute hepatitis serologies negative, Hep A IgG positive, IgM 
negative.  LFTs were improving by the time of discharge.  Pt was 
given strict instructions to avoid any alcohol and limit Tylenol 
intake

"RIEF SUMMARY STATEMENT:
================================
___ man with metastatic lung cancer currently on chemotherapy 
at ___ (last dose 3 weeks ago), who presented to 
___ for abdominal pain, found to have an abdominal 
abscess on CT. Upon his transfer to ___, surgery and 
interventional radiology determined that he did not require 
surgery. For his infection, he was initially treated with 
Vanc/Zosyn, which were narrowed to Cipro/Flagyl on ___. During 
this admission, he had stool-like drainage from his chronic 
enterocutaneous fistula next to his ostomy. Surgery was 
re-consulted to evaluate the patient, and determined no surgical 
intervention was necessary, because the drainage stopped and 
this was consistent with prior symptoms. Of note, he was 
neutropenic on admission, but ___ normalized by ___. At time of 
discharge, he was afebrile and had no abdominal pain.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
================================
#Abdominal abscess: OSH CT showed R lateral inferior abscess 
medial to the surgical clips and adjacent to a lateral right 
inflamed ileal loop, which could represent fistula or focal 
perforation in the right pelvic ileal loop. He was started on 
Vanc/Zosyn initially, then narrow to Cipro/Flagyl, per ID recs. 
he remained stable on this.  

#Enterocutaneous fistula drainage: Pt has been followed up for 
this issue in the past, last at the ___ in ___ as per EMR. EC 
fistula developed from a complication of the cystoprostatectomy. 
As per the pt, he also required antibiotics as treatment. 
Concern for compromising urostomy. while here, he had some 
drainage. ACS consulted, saw pt on ___, rec. no surgeries 
i/s/o active chemotherapy treatment. continued Cipro/Flagyl, as 
above, with plans to repeat imaging (see transitional issues).

#Neutropenia - Resolved: ___ 470 on admission, but quickly 
normalized. Likely ___ chemotherapy, which he received 3 weeks 
ago. At high risk of further infections.

CHRONIC STABLE ISSUES:
================================
#Metastatic lung cancer: Treated at ___ by Dr. 
___ (Cisplatin/Etoposide s/p 3 of 6 cycles). Dr. ___ 
___ and made note of his admission.

#HTN: Continued home ASA 81 & ACE

================================
# INTRAABDOMINAL ABSCESS: Continue cipro 500mg BID and flagyl 
500mg q8hrs for the next 2 weeks (through ___. Repeat CT A/P 
in 2 weeks. Based on that scan:
- If abscess has resolved, stop antibiotics
- If abscess is improving but not fully resolved, Infectious 
Disease should determine length of antibiotic source
- If abscess is unchanged or worse, patient will need 
Interventional Radiology consultation to determine if abscess 
can be drained. 

# ID FOLLOW-UP: Patient should follow up with ID in ___ weeks. 
We offered to set up an appointment at ___, but patient would 
prefer to see a specialist closer to his home in ___. 
Please arrange this follow up 

# ONCOLOGY FOLLOW UP: Patient was scheduled for his ___ cycle of 
chemotherapy at ___, but this was cancelled due to 
his current admission & infection. Our team spoke with his

# R leg MRSA cellulitis: The diagnosis is consistent with his 
h/o chronic venous stasis, presentation, and potential entry 
wound in R leg. Given his h/o MRSA cellulitis (___) and given 
the cellulitis emergence while he was on cefpodoxime for 
sinusitis, this is likely MRSA cellulitis. He was started on 
vancomycin (day 1: ___, and leg elevation. Blood cultures were 
pending. Since admission, the area of warmth/redness in his 
right leg has decreased significantly. Patient was switched from 
IV vancomycin to PO bactrim on HD#4, and he was discharged home 
with PO ciprofloxacin 6 days.

# Hypoxemia: After arrival on the floor from the ED, O2 desat 
from 96%RA to 89%RA (and 97%4L). It is unclear if this relates 
to 1L NS given in the ED, leading to pulmonary edema. 
Nevertheless, patient was asymptomatic. Portable CXR was 
consistent with worsening pulmonary edema. ACS was unlikely 
given no chest pain, no acute ST changes on EKG. PE was unlikely 
given negative ___ and therapeutic INR. Overnight, his 
hypoxemia resolved, and his O2 sat improved with diuresis using 
lasix 20mg IV.

A/P: ___ w/ Strep viridans endocarditis of unknown source was 
found to have vegetations on the mitral valve who is currently 
stable without any evidence of embolization.

# Bacteremia: Pt has strep viridans bactermeia of unclear 
source. She did have recent dental work, which is the likely 
source. Her TEE shows a vegetation on the  mitral valve. She was 
started on Vancomycin and sensitivities from the OSH who was 
running the tests showed MIC =0.25 for ceftriaxone. A PICC was 
placed for an anticipated 4 weeks of ceftriaxone to treat for 
endocarditis. Infectious disease was following and will see the 
pt as an outpatient for continued treatment.

The pt remained afebrile during her stay. Her blood cultures 
from an OSH were positive for strep viridans, but her cultures 
here were NGTD at the time of discharge. She will complete a 4 
week course of antibiotics for treatment. At some point in the 
future the pt will need to be evaluated by Cardiac Surgery given 
the progression of her mitral valve disease and newly diagnosed 
endocarditis.

#  Abdominal Pain: Has had extensive prior workup which has been 
unrevealing. GI was consulted and felt her presentation was 
consistent with a functional disorder such as chronic 
constipation or narcotic bowel syndrome. Given her ability to 
have a BM every ___ days with her current bowel regimen and her 
inability to tolerate HD without narcotics it is difficult to 
treat her further for this syndrome however we have instituted a 
more aggressive bowel regimen and bentyl to help with her 
constipation. We consulted pain service to help with a pain 
regimen that would not include as many narcotics as well as 
decreasing the dose of narcotics. They recommended tizanidine 
and neurontin which we have started in low doses given her renal 
disease. They did not feel she was a candidate for ___ epidural 
block given that her pain migrated from chest to abdomen. The 
also recommended as well weaning the dilaudid to 0.5mg PO Q6H. 
We started a lidoderm patch at the site of tenderness as well. 
We also sent out labs to check for celiac disease which were 
pending at the time of discharge and other rare causes of 
abdominal pain such as porphyria. These labs are pending and 
will be followed up by her gastroenterologist as ___ outpatient.  
She was also evaluated by psychiatry as it was felt that the 
most likely etiology of her pain is a combinationg of 
psychologic and functional abdominal pain along with 
gastroparesis and constipation. Psychiatry and the pain service 
felt she should continue to try to wean narcotics and ativan and 
to continue to have her work with social workers and 
case___ around looking for housing and other social issues 
that may be contributing to her somatic complaints. in addition, 
psychiatry felt that given the multitude of medications she is 
on it would be wise to wean the ativan and d/c the ambien so as 
to avoid overmedicating her. As below we have also decided to 
give her  1mg dose of dilaudid prior to HD sessions in ___ effort 
to help her tolerate these better. Most importantly she will 
follow up with her new gastroenterologist to establish care 
shortly after discharge to ensure there are no further 
diagnostics tests necessary and to start to manage this 
abdominal pain as ___ outpatient rather than necessitating 
inpatient admissions each time she had a flare. Her pain, 
nausea, and diet regimen upon readmission should include only:
-Dilaudid 0.5mg q6h (with the addition now of 1mg QHD)
-Dilaudid 0.125mg in 50cc NS over 15 min BID:PRN breakthrough 
pain
-fludrocortisone 0.1 mg BID
-metoclopramide 5 mg QIDACHS
-ondansetron 4 mg q8h prn nausea
-omeprazole 20 mg Capsule, Delayed Release daily
- stage 5 bariatric diet as on prior admissions
- Lidocaine patch
- tizanidine 1mg QHS
- neurontin 100mg QHS
- hydroxyzine PRN itching/anxiety
- Ativan 1mg PO Q6H PRN anxiety if hydroxyzine is not sufficient
.  
#  ECG changes: Patient does have remote history of CAD but has 
P-MIBI with normal perfusion just a few weeks ago and, although 
this can miss three vessel coronary disease, it is unlikely the 
ECG changes represent myocardial ischemia. Troponin was actually 
below her baseline in our records in the setting of chronic 
renal insufficiency and ECG changes are not actually different 
in looking back to ECG prior to this one. Troponins remained 
flat and she was transitioned back to 81mg ___ and ___ home 
doses of statin, metoprolol for known CAD. The patient had chest 
pain with dialysis twice while admitted. At the time her BP was 
140/80 so it was thought unlikely demand ischemia from 
hypotension during HD, ECG was unchanged, and troponins remained 
flat. The pain responded to IV metoprolol on the first episode 
and IV dilaudid on the second episode. It did not respond to any 
PO medications including nitro. ___ RN who knew the patient from 
prior hospitalizations and dialysis sessions at the ___ said 
she has been having these problems for years and it is only ever 
responsive to IV medications calling into question whether the 
patients symptoms are really of ___ organic cause. To work up the 
chest pain completely, cardiology was consulted and felt her 
pain was inconsistent with cardiac pain and she should not have 
further workup for this pain. Her pain was treated as above.
.
#  ESRD on HD: Gets HD ___. continued hd here with 
pre-medication with 1mg dilaudid PO prior to HD this controlled 
her abdominal pain but she began instead to have chest pain 
during dialysis.  Going forward she will continue to get 
dialysis sessions three times weekly with no IV pain medications 
offered as it is felt this will potentiate her behavior. She 
will likely need to discuss with her nephrologists whether 
dialysis is still ___ option for her if this continues as she 
cannot seem to tolerate the treatments and IV narcotics are not 
a long term solution for this complication. She will be 
pre-medicated with zofran, benedryl and other antiemetics as 
well as 1mg PO dilaudid prior to HD sessions PRN to help her get 
through the HD.

# Behavioral disorder (axis II pathology, possible borderline 
personality) seen by psych on recent admission and again on this 
admission as above. They feel she is competent to make medical 
decisions and that her pain is likely ___ functional pain 
syndrome associated with drug seeking behaviors.  During this 
admission we followed psychiatric recommendations which 
included:
- Continue quetiapine 50mg QHS
- Patient will require psychiatry follow-up after discharge at 
her nursing home
- Set clear limits on patient 
- Standing narcotics as above
- continue benedryl, hydroxyzine for itching 
- Wean ativan
- D/C zolpidem

# Chronic corneal ulcer: continued home eye drops
# Code: confirmed full  
# Communication: Patient

Transitions of Care:
- Labs pending at time of discharge include:
serum complement levels (C3, C4, C1 inhibitor), C1 esterase 
inhibitor assay, tryptase, porphobilinogen, and ALA levels and 
will be followed up by her GI specialist as ___ outpatient.
- Patient will continue to discuss with her nephrologist, dr. 
___ decision of whether to continue dialysis given 
that it causes her undue distress and constant pain only 
responsive to IV medications.
- Patient will need to be set up with a chronic pain 
appointment. Her PCP at the rehab needs to schedule this for her 
as we were unable to do this at our clinic because her PCP is at

# COPD exacerbation: Pt was admitted with shortness of breath 
and wheezing consistent with prior COPD exacerbations. Her ABG 
prior to BiPAP 7.___/42/41. Based on review of the record, pt 
is a chronic retainer and her PCO2 runs in the 60's to 70's and 
is unfortunately still smoking. In the ICU, pt was non-compliant 
with BiPAP so she was transitioned to NC quickly. She was 
started on prednisone 40 mg, albuterol and ipratropium nebs and 
azithromycin with rapid improvement in her respiratory status. 
At time of discharge, pt was satting 95% on 2L, which is 
consistent with her baseline. She is discharged with a 10 day 
prednisone burst and 5 days of azithromycin. 

# Acute on chronic dCHF exacerbation: Pt's initial chest xray 
was concerning for prominent pulmonary edema and bilateral 
effusions so she was diuresed with IV lasix in the unit, 
transitioned to PO on the floor. Her exacerbation is likely 
secondary to decreasing lasix dose at her nursing home facility. 
She is discharged on lasix 100 mg daily, with instructions to 
have her BMP checked early next week to monitor potassium and 
creatinine. Weight at discharge was 277 lb.

Ms ___ is a ___ yo postmenopausal woman who was admitted to the 
gynecological service with worsening left lower quadrant pain of 
unclear etiology for observation and pain control. The following 
points summarise her hospitalisation on the GYN service prior to 
her transfer to medicine on ___ for further management of her 
seizure disorder. 
.
1. Abdominal pain: She was intially seen in the ___ clinic, at 
which time she was referred for further evaluation of this 
worsened LLQ pain with a pelvic US. The US showed no evidence of 
torsion or rutpured ovarian cyst. She was then admitted to the 
GY admission/ She was given dilaudid IV with adequate pain 
control over the first night of her admission. In the morning, 
she noted improvement in her pain but had persistent tenderness 
on her exam. She had no nausea/vomiting, fever, chills. However, 
as a result of tenderness elicited on exam, she was recommended 
for CT abdomen with contrast to assess for any bowel pathology. 
No evidence of diverticulitis or bowel obstruction was noted. 
Present on both her CT and US were two benign appearing cysts on 
her left ovary measuring no more than 2-3 cm in largest 
diameter. These have been stable over hte last year.  On the day 
of discharge she did not complain of any abdominal pain.  Whe 
will follow up with her primary doctor and gynecology as an 
outpatient.
.
2. Ovarian cysts: The patient has been followed by her PCP and 
GYN at OSH for left ovarian cysts. On her US evaluation, these 
cysts were seen on the left measuring no more than 2.9cm in 
largest diameter. A Ca-125 was checked and noted to be low in 
measurement. She was counselled on options for care including 
observation with serial US vs diagnostic laparoscopy with 
possible BSO. She was not interested in surgery and agreed to 
follow these cysts as an outpatient. She will be seeing the GYN 
oncologist Dr ___ on ___ at which time she can discuss this 
again.
.
3. ___: The patient was diagnosed with ___ based on CT findings. 
This has not been confirmed with tissue biopsy yet. 
Nevertheless, the patient has been devastated by this news and 
has been seen as an outpatient by her psychiatrist. While she 
was in house she declined social work support and indicated she 
felt she was coping adequately with her her family. She will be 
seeing Dr ___ on ___.3 to discuss this diagosis further.
.
4. Postmenopausal bleeding: The patient reported PMB following 
her TVUS. Although this is likely secondary to trauma, 
endometrial pathology cannot be excluded. She has been 
recommended for office based endometrial biopsy on ___ with Dr 
___. 
.
5. Seizure disorder: The patient reports a seizure disorder well 
controlled with Trileptal. On the day of her discharge from GYN, 
she reported the incidence of simple partial seizures on a 
repeated basis after completing her CT evaluation on hospital 
day #2. One such seizure was witnessed by the GYN resident and 
appeared to be a brief episode of non-responsiveness on the part 
of the patient, lasting a few seconds only, with no involuntary 
bodily movements and with return to responsiveness after ___ 
seconds, also accompanied by closing of her eyes, with opening 
at the end of the 15 second interval. As the patient reported 
several of such episodes, and did not have adequate follow-up 
from hre neurologist at OSH, she was evaluated by medicine and 
transferred to their service for further management of her 
seizure disorder; She had no futher episodes.  Her outpatient 
neurologist's office was contacted and her case discussed with 
Dr. ___ on the evening before discharge.  Dr. ___ 
that these events have been previously described and frequent, 
and that she will likely need to have her antiepileptic drugs 
titrated up should these events become more frequent.  Given the 
long history of these episodes, never resulting in any injury 
and her known seizure disorder, no further inpatient workup was 
felt necessary.  She will follow up with her outpatient 
neurologist to discuss whether any titration of her medications 
is indicated. 
.
At the time of her discharge, she was tolerating a regular diet, 
ambulating, urinating without difficulty.  She described only a 
slight frontal headache which she felt was due to a sinus 
infection.  There was no evidence of sinus infection on exam or 
data (no leukocytosis, fever, or purulent discharge or 
congestion).  Her neurologic exam was non-focal.  Her headache 
was most consistent with a tension-type headache, and she was 
prescribed oral oxycodone to treat this pain for a short 
duration.  She was instructed to follow up with her primary 
doctor if these headaches persist.

Mr. ___ is a ___ with recent admission to ___ (___) 
after fall with a conservatively managed right SDH, and a repeat 
mechanical fall after that discharge with head strike, found to 
have a new SDH. Hospital course notable for operative SDH 
management, HCAP and coag negative staph bacteremia (both s/p 
Abx courses), lack of appetite, and occasional urinary 
retention.

In brief, patient had been at his rehab following a stay for SDH 
which was managed conservatively. He had a fall on ___ and was 
evaluated at an OSH where imaging revealed an enlarging SDH. He 
was transferred to ___ and after evaluation underwent a right 
craniotomy for evacuation of SDH. He had a subdural drain placed 
to bulb suction in the OR, was extubated after the procedure, 
and transferred to the PACU for further management and care. On 
___, he spiked a fever to 101.5F and was found to have PNA and 
pyuria; his subdural drain was pulled; he was also found to have 
coagulase negative staph bacteremia; ID was consulted and he was 
started on vancomycin and cefepime (see below). 

Active Issues:

# Lack of appetite, concern for low nutrition: Pt had nausea and 
odynophagia as above with meals. He was initially unable to take 
his medications ___ pain with swallowing. He was seen by speech 
and swallow, and the nutrition team. Unclear etiology, but 
appears most likely ___ odynophagia, possibly depression, and 
lack of appetite in setting of acute illness and neurosurgery; 
constipation may have contributed and his bowel regimen was 
uptitrated. We started him on pantoprazole 40mg daily and 
Maalox/Lidocaine with meals, ondansetron with meals, and 
low-dose mirtazapine. After several days of encouraging PO 
intake and ensure supplements, intake was still low and dobhoff 
was placed on ___, but it was self-d/c'd by pt due to mild 
confusion. Dobhoff was not replaced; pt has been intaking about 
800kcal/day which is likely an underestimate; his PO intake 
should be strongly encouraged and nutrition f/u will be 
necessary at rehab.

# Urinary retention: During ___ week of admission pt had foley 
catheter, which was removed; foley had to be replaced after 1 
day due to low UOP; after several days foley was removed again 
on ___ for voiding trial. Pt's bladder scans showed >500cc's 
but upon straight cath x 2 the void amount was about 300cc's. Pt 
should be monitored for urinary retention, and foley catheter 
placed if low UOP or bladder scan showing >500-600cc's, and 
voiding trial held several days or 1 week after foley placement.

Treated/Improving Issues:

# Odynophagia vs demand ischemia vs NSTEMI: On ___, he 
complained of chest pain and was found to have an unchanged EKG, 
with troponins at 5.18 at 0520 (added-on), 4.55 at 1255, and 
4.53 at ___ with CK-MB at 7-->6-->5. He was given 1 unit of 
pRBCs given concern for demand ischemia. Cardiology and 
neurosurgery were consulted and he was started on aspirin 81mg 
daily. On ___, he was triggered for ___ chest pain after 
receiving his PO pain meds and had an unchanged EKG with 
troponins downtrending at 4.21 and CK-MB at 4, his pain improved 
slightly with nitroglycerin x2. His troponins were down-trending 
and CK-MB was not elevated c/w a possible MI several days ago, 
but no evidence of an acute event. It is possible that an MI 
precipitated his fall at the rehab. His chest discomfort 
appeared to occur in the setting of PO med administration and he 
was visibly uncomfortable while swallowing water. Speech and 
swallow observed odynophagia as well. His TTE was unchanged from 
prior, which further argued against an acute cardiac event. His 
chest pain and swallowing gradually improved with a PPI and 
Maalox/Lidocaine with meals.

# SDH: He presented with an acute on chronic SDH ___ mechanical 
fall s/p right-sided craniotomy for evacuation, resection of 
membranes, and duraplasty. He had fluctuating levels of 
attention during his hospitalization with no focal neurological 
changes. He had a mild stable left facial droop. His systolic 
blood pressure was maintained below 160. He was started on 
levetiracetam 750mg twice a day, which he should continue until 
he has a neurosurgery follow-up appointment. Per neurosurgery, 
his Coumadin (for afib) should still be held until neurosurgery 
f/u in early ___.

# Pulmonary edema: During his hospitalization, he had 
intermittent ___ NC oxygen requirement off and on. He had a 
chest x-ray on ___ that showed increased prominence of the 
cardiac silhouette with substantial pulmonary edema likely ___ 
volume overload in the setting of receiving IVF. He received 
Lasix and had good urine output. He was then mostly saturating 
well on room air but occasionally desatted to low ___ and 
improved with ___ NC, which was then weaned within 0.5 to 1 
day. His latest CXR on ___ showed interval mild improvement in 
pulmonary edema and pleural effusions. 

# HCAP: He was febrile on ___ and had a chest x-ray that 
showed His pneumonia was likely secondary to aspiration. He 
completed a one week course of cefepime and on discharge, he was 
afebrile, without a leukocytosis. 

# GPC Bacteremia: He had a blood culture that grew coagulase 
negative staph with resistance to oxacillin. Per ID, he was 
started on vancomycin and completed a one week course with no 
other growth on follow-up bacterial cultures. He had a TTE that 
did not show endocarditis. On discharge, he was afebrile and 
without a leukocytosis.

# Macrocytic anemia: He was found to have a hematocrit that was 
reduced from his baseline and he received 1 unit of pRBCs when 
his hematocrit was 22.9 and having chest discomfort, which was 
concerning for demand ischemia. His hematocrit appropriately 
increased. There was no evidence of bleeding. He was discharged 
with a stable hematocrit and on ferrous sulfate 325mg twice a 
day.

# Pyuria: On ___, he was febrile to 101.5F, with a urine of 73 
WBC, 21 RBC, few bacteria, mod leuks. We monitored his urine 
output and discontinued his foley prior to discharge.

# H/o atrial fibrillation: We continued his amiodarone 200 mg PO 
SUN, TUES, THURS, SAT.

# HTN: We increased his home metoprolol tartrate to 25mg 
succinate daily from his home dose of 6.25mg in the setting of 
his NSTEMI. We continued his isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg daily.

# CVD: We continued his home atorvastatin 80 mg and aspirin 
81mg.

# CKD: His creatinine remained elevated at his baseline of 
around 2.0. We renally dosed his medications.

# Gout: We continued his home allopurinol ___ mg daily.

# Pain: He did not endorse significant amounts of pain during 
the hospitalization and was treated with acetaminophen 650mg 
TID, and several PRN medications postop including tramadol, 
oxycodone, and morphine.

# Angina: We continued his home ranolazine 500 mg BID.

___ with a PMH of deafness (knows ASL), IDDM, uterine fibroids, 
and a recent admission to ___ with strep intermedius bacteremia 
and spinal hemangiomas who presented with back pain, abdominal 
pain, constipation. 

====================
ACUTE MEDICAL ISSUES
====================
# Abdominal Pain: Likely multifactorial abdominal pain given 
opioid induced constipation at presentation and known uterine 
fibroids. She presented on a regimen of methadone, but was 
interested in pursuing a non-opioid regimen. She was started on 
Naproxen 500PO BID, acetaminophen 500 q6hr, gabapentin 300TID, 
300QHS, lidocaine patch, started cyclopbenzaprine 10mg qhs with 
oxycodone 5mg q8hrs. This provided some relief, and we counseled 
her that total relief may take some time. A pelvic MRI was not 
concerning for malignancy, and showed a uterine fibroid. A CT 
abd/pelvis otherwised showed stable hepatomegaly. Finally, we 
started an aggressive bowel regimen including Colace, senna and 
miralax. 

#Back pain with known spinal cord lesion and hemangiomas: There 
is a L4/L5 facet cyst, with plan for follow up at ___ by ___ 
after completion of antibiotics for bacteremia for possible 
decompression and steroid injection. She was also found on 
PET-CT and MRI to have spinal hemangiomas, and will repeat 
PET-CT/MRI in early to mid ___ at ___.

Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with CAD (c/b MI s/p PCI to 
LAD in ___ on ASA), HFpEF (LVEF 65%), COPD/emphysema (on home 
O2), Hx of breast cancer (s/p l mastectomy s/p chemo XRT), and 
recent upper GIB, who presented to the ED with dyspnea and 
weakness, and is admitted with BRBPR. 

# Acute on chronic anemia 
# History of Arteriovenous malformation 
# Bright red blood per rectum 
The patient presented with acute on chronic anemia in the 
setting BRBPR for about one month. She has a history of GI 
bleeding secondary to arteriovenous malformations status post 
argon plasma coagulation. Patient has had ongoing GI bleeding 
since treatment. Patient underwent colonoscopy and EGD on 
___. EGD did not demonstrate source of bleeding. Colonoscopy 
with some blood in cecum, no clear source with inadequate prep. 
Capsule study performed that did not identify source. The 
highest suspicion regarding the source of the pt's bleeding is 
either colonic or small bowel. Reassuringly the patient remained 
hemodynamically stable though with downtrending Hgb on CBC - 
suspicious for slow bleed. Over course of hospitalization 
___, she received 4 units of pRBC. Her HgB on discharge is 
8.8. She will get weekly CBCs via home nursing initially after 
discharge to ensure her counts are stable. And GI has scheduled 
her for follow-up in clinic and repeat studies as outpatient 
(see below).

# Malnutrition
Patient at risk of ongoing malnutrition in setting of GI
evaluations and need for being NPO. Patient has 7% weight loss
over past three months. She was started on multivitamin per 
nutrition recs. Will continue low-residue diet for outpatient 
colonoscopy.

# ___
Presented with Cr 1.3 from baseline of 0.8-1.0. Likely pre-renal 
insult due to reduced renal perfusion in setting of acute on 
chronic anemia, and now with ___ prep and NPO. Her home 
torsemide was held while in house. Recommend resuming upon 
discharge. 

# Initial concern for PNA
CXR in the ED notable for mild opacification in R lung base 
though no PNA clinically so will not treat as such. Did not 
receive abx treatment.

# Asymptomatic Bacteriuria
Patient had ___ E.coli in urine culture on presentation. She
denied dysuria during the hospitalization.

# CAD c/b MI s/p PCI
Pt w/ chronic angina and a significant cardiac hx w/ MI s/p PCI. 
CP not acutely worsened and EKG w/o concerning ST changes. ASA 
was continued for secondary prevention despite active bleeding 
given HD stable. We continued her low-dose aspirin and home 
metoprolol. 

# COPD on home O2 
Some of her home inhalers were not on formulary and were 
substituted. Patient oxygenated well on home supplemental oxygen 
(3L via nasal cannula).

# History of seizures
We continued home Keppra. 

# Anxiety
We continued home Xanax PRN anxiety.

# HTN
She was not on any home anti-hypertensives aside from beta 
blocker upon arrival. We chose to defer starting given active 
bleed, however patient would likely benefit from BP medications 
in the future. BPs were 120-150s/70s-80s at day of discharge 
without treatment.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[ ] Hgb on discharge 8.8
[ ] Will get ___ checks for hemoglobin monitoring
[ ] Patient should see her PCP ___ ___ to follow up 
bleeding, CBC.
[ ] Plan for follow up with GI and then repeat colonoscopy and 
capsule study on ___
[ ] Discharged on low-residue diet with plan for two day prep 
before studies above
[ ] Torsemide held while in house given bleeding, should resume 
upon discharge. 
[ ] Patient with blood pressures 120-150s/70s-80s, would 
consider starting outpatient antihypertensive

Ms. ___ is clinically stable for discharge today. The total 
time spent today on discharge planning, counseling and 
coordination of care today was greater than 30 minutes.

___ F with HTN and hypothyroidism who presents after a brief 
syncopal episode, subsequently found to have a U/A c/f UTI found 
to have short pauses on telemetry.

ACUTE ISSUES:
# SYNCOPE: Given her lack of pertinent neurological findings and 
normal glucose, both seizure and hypoglcemia were quickly ruled 
out as possible causes of her syncopal presentation. Negative 
cardiac enzymes and non-ischemic EKGs also ruled out acute 
ischemic etiology. After admission, she was closely monitored on 
telemetry and found to have pauses up to 3 seconds associated 
with mild nausea but otherwise asymptomatic. During her hospital 
course, her antihypertensives were initially decreased, since 
she continued to have positive orthostatic signs. She was seen 
by the Electrophysiology team who recommended a pacemaker, 
however it was alternatively suggested that her 
antihypertensives were the causative factor in both her pauses 
and orthostasis. Per recommendations from Dr. ___, she 
was started on a trial of complete discontinuation of her 
antihypertensive regimen with close follow-up with him in 
clinic. She was also discharged with ___ of Hearts monitor 
for further work-up. Aside from her orthostatics, she had 
otherwise remained hemodynamically stable throughout her 
hospital course.

# UTI: U/A positive on admission. She was empirically started on 
Bactrim for coverage. However, culture from ___ revealed 
>100,000 CFUS of E. coli, resistant to both cipro and Bactrim. 
Her Bactrim was therefore discontinued, and she was instead 
started on a 7 day course of cefpodoxime.

# HYPERTENSION: Despite her positive orthostatics, her blood 
pressure was intermittently well-controlled on decreased doses 
of her home antihypertensives. Given the concern for their role 
in sinus pauses/AV blockade, however, her regimen was 
discontinued as outlined above. She will have close follow-up 
with Dr. ___ further adjustments if necessary.

CHRONIC DIAGNOSES:

# HYPOTHYROIDISM: No acute issues. Continued on home 
levothyroxine. TSH within normal limits during admission.

# HYPERLIPIDEMIA: No acute issues. Continued on home 
rosuvastatin.

Mr. ___ was taken to the operating suite on the day of 
admission for an elective craniotomy and left temporal lobe 
resection and hippocampectomy.  As scheduled, the patient was 
awake during the operative procedure.  Neuromonitoring was 
available during the procedure and Neurology was also present to 
evaluate the patient during the mapping portion of the 
procedure.  Please see the operative note for further details.  
Overall, there were no intra-operative complications.  The 
patient was taken to the ICU immediately for recovery, close 
observation and ongoing management.

Post-operatively, the patient was slow to awaken.  He had 
periods of full orientation versus disorientation, often stating 
""I don't know"" to basic questions.  He was intermittently 
following commands but full strength throughout.  He was started 
immediately on his home anti-seizure medication regimen.  A 
post-operative head CT showed normal post-surgical changes and 
no acute intracranial bleeding.  His diet was advanced as 
tolerated and IV fluids discontinued.

He remained stable overnight into ___ and on morning rounds was 
oriented x 3, full strength, and had no focal deficits. He was 
deemed fit for trasnfer to the floor. In the early afternoon he 
had a very mild seizure lasting a few seconds which self 
resolved. He was trasnferred to the floor later in the 
afternoon. 

On ___, his pain was controlled with pain medicine. He had an 
MRI of the brain. Per the patient, he had one small seizure (3 
total since surgery). Mental status had returned to baseline.

On ___, he had no further seizures. He was seen by physical 
therapy who recommended he return home at discharge. 

On ___, he was seen by neuro for headache. Patient reported 
that he had been having one brief seizure each day since surgery 
consisting of brief loss of awareness. Neurology recommended 
continuing home seizure meds and adjusting his pain regimen with 
lower more frequent doses of pain meds. He also complained of 
constipation since the operation, and his bowel regimen was 
changed.

The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the 
operating room on ___ where the patient underwent Coronary 
artery bypass grafting x2 with
left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior 
descending and reverse saphenous vein graft to the posterior 
descending artery. Overall the patient tolerated the procedure 
well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable 
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. POD 1 found the 
patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably. 
 The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically 
stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was 
initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the 
preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to the 
telemetry floor for further recovery.  Over several days, he 
continued to make clinical improvements with diuresis.  He was 
discharged with creatinine at baseline on lasix x 10 days.  
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without 
complication. White blood cell count peaked at 16K and cultures 
remained negative. By discharge, his white count decreased to 
12.6 and he remained afebrile.  He was noted to have scant lower 
pole sternal drainage with no click appreciated at the time of 
discharge. The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy 
service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time 
of discharge on POD 4 the patient was ambulating freely, the

Mr. ___ is a ___ h/o of Child ___ Class B NASH cirrhosis 
(decompensated with HE), presenting with confusion and subdural 
hemorrhage.  

# ENCEPHALOPATHY - Patient presented with confusion from 
multiple possible etiologies. Initial head CT determined that he 
had a subdural hemmorhage and neurosurgery was urgently 
consulted. Based on the evaluation it was determined no 
interventions were needed and they determined he had no need for 
outpatient follow up. He did have asterixis on admission and was 
given acute encephalopathic doses of lactulose with improvement 
in his symptoms. He was eventually transitioned to TID dosing 
with stabilization of his neurologic function. Additionally he 
was found to have a high lithium level and per discussion with 
pharmacy this dose was held until his lithium level normalized. 
He also was on a significant amount of sedating/deliriogenic 
medications which were largely held. With all these 
interventions he improved significantly to near his basline 
mental status. No fevers, leukocytosis. CXR not concerning for 
infection. RUQ with no evidence of portal vein thrombosis. UA 
unremarkable with mixed flora. Utox with positive opiates, serum 
tox negative. Patient was continued on riaximin as well. 

# Functional status: Patient has has several unwitnessed falls 
recently. Also admitted ___ after an MVC and no CT head was 
done then, given the layering of the SDH this could be a chronic 
SDH from the ___ in early ___. The patient was evaluated by 
physical therapy and occupational therapy and recommended for 
short term stay at rehab due to concern about his safety at 
home. 

# Child ___ Class B NASH Cirrhosis. Pt is on rifaximin and 
lactulose at home. No h/o varices in past, last EGD was ___. 
MELD on admission was 12. He was setup for an EGD for variceal 
screening on discharge.
 
# Bipolar disorder- Patient is on large doses of seroquel, 
lithium, oxazepam, zyprexa and trazodone. These medications were 
held on admission. His lithium was initially held but then 
restarted. His doses of trazodone and oxazepam were decreased in 
due to his profound altered mental status.
 
# Chronic pain- due to prior back surgery. Initially opiates 
held given AMS and then gradually restarted pain medications.

# Acute on chronic kidney injury: Cr 1.8 on admission, range 
1.2-1.4. Not high enough to treat for HRS, but if continues to 
increase in AM, would give albumin challenge. Now resolved to 
creatinine of 1.1. His lisinopril and propnalol were initially 
held while he had ___.

#Transitional Issue:
Nodular opacity in LLL on CXR ___ last admission, consider 
outpatient CT chest to evaluate  
If any concern for neurologic issues please call neurosurgery 
for an appointment  at ___, but he does not need acute 
follow up.

___ yo M with hx of RA and possible OA, s/p b/l THR, now admitted 
with MSSA bacteremia and septic arthritis, requiring several 
surgical washout's and eventual explant of left hip prosthesis.  

.
ACTIVE ISSUES
# MSSA bacteremia with left septic hip: Patient presented with L 
hip pain that had been ongoing for multiple weeks prior to 
presentation. At the time of admission, OSH artherocentesis 
showed synovial fluid that had 63,000 WBC, concerning for a 
septic joint. The patient was started on vancomycin at the OSH 
and transferred to ___ for further care. The patient was 
initially admitted to Orthopaedic Trauma service on ___. On 
___, Infectious Disease was consulted. OSH blood cultures and 
sensitivities were obtained and were notable for MSSA 
bacteremia. Per ID recommendations, vancomycin was switched to 
nafcillin. Though the patient remained afebrile and 
hemodynamically stable, ID recommended that medicine be 
consulted, and the patient was subsequently transferred to the 
medicine service. 
.
The source for the MSSA bacteremia was not immediately clear, 
but was initially thought to be secondary to an abscess on the 
patient's L hand. The patient underwent I&D of the L hand 
abscess and ___ and ___ by the Plastic Surgery service. 
Cultures from those procedures grew MSSA. While on the medicine 
service, the Orthopaedic team also continued to be heavily 
involved. The patient underwent multiple procedures, including a 
L hip washout on ___, where large amounts of purulent material 
was found to be surrounding the L prosthetic hip. On ___ L hip 
washout was repeated ___ the OR and L shoulder and R wrist 
washouts were performed as well, since the patient had 
subsequently developed significant pain, warm, and decreased 
range of motion ___ those joints as well. Cultures from the L hip 
washout grew MSSA, but no bacteria were isolated from the L 
shoulder or the R wrist. Because such a significant amount of 
purulent material was found ___ the L hip during both surgical 
procedures, the decision was made to undergo complete L hip 
explant with the hope of obtaining source control of the 
bacteremia. This procedure was only able to be done on the ___ campus, and therefore, on ___ the patient was 
transferred to Dr. ___.  Pt underwent explant of the 
left hip prosthesis with placement of antibiotic spacer on 
___.  He tolerated the procedure well.  Tissue culture 
taken from OR confirmed MSSA bacteria.  He will need at minimum 
6 weeks of IV antibiotic therapy.  He will be followed by 
Orthopedics clinic, with plan for new prosthesis ___ 
approximately 8 weeks if infection is clear.  A CT scan of the 
left pelvis for surgical planning was obtained, with final read 
pending at time of discharge.  He will need 4 weeks of Lovenox 
post-op (___).  He is NWB of the left leg.
.
___ terms of medical treatment of his MSSA bacteremia, he had a 
TTE that did not show vegetations, and reportedly, an intra-op 
TEE was done and negative as well, although there is no formal 
documentation.  He had a PICC line placed and will need minimum 
6 weeks of antibiotics.  He will be followed by ___ clinic.  He 
is currently on IV Vancomycin due to drug rash to Nafcillin and 
Cefazolin.  He will need close vancomycin level monitoring.  
Last dose adjustment to his Vancomycin dose was on ___ AM, 
increased from 1mg IV Q12H to 1.5mg IV Q8H.
.
.
# DRUG RASH - On nafcillin, patient developed a rash on the 
trunk and extremities consistent with a drug rash.  He was 
switched to cefazolin, but rash worsened, likely a 
cross-reactivity.  As such, both cefazolin and nafcillin have 
been added to his allergy list ___ the ___ medical record.  He 
was treated symptomatically with Benadryl and Sarna lotion.  He 
did has an eosinophillia c/w drug rash.  He was switched to IV 
Vancomycin for MSSA bacteremia, and his rash continued to 
resolve.      
.
.
# Depression:  pt expressed general feeling of depression, as 
well as other symptoms including anhedonia, loss of appetite.  
These symptoms were worsened by his prolonged hospitalization, 
but pre-date the hospitalization.  He has never been on 
pharmacotherapy for depression, nor has he seen a therapist or 
psychiatrist.  He did not endorse homicidal or suicidal 
ideation.  He wished to start pharmacotherapy.  He is agreeable 
to seeing a therapist as an outpatient.  He will need referral 
to therapist on discharge from rehab.  He will need 
psychotherapy at rehab.  He is being started on an SSRI 
(sertraline) at low dose.  
.
.
# Rheumatoid Arthritis / Polyarthritis: The patient has a known 
history of rheumatoid arthritis. On presentation, he was noted 
to have diffusely swollen joints of his fingers and hands that 
was thought to potentially be consistent with a superimposed RA 
flare ___ addition to septic joints. He was seen by Rheumatology 
who recommended RF and CCP testing, both of which were negative 
for RA (RF 12 - nl ___ and CCP negative). Therefore, the 
decision was made to continue his home prednisone dosing at 5 mg 
PO BID. At the urging of ID, no stress dosing was given, since 
the patient was hemodynamically stable and was bacteremic.  
.
.
# Purpuric skin lesions: Initially these purpuric hand lesions 
were noted to be similar to those seen ___ ___'s sarcoma. 
Given the extent of his bacteremia, the question of 
immunocompromise was raised, but HIV testing was negative. 
Dermatology was not consulted as this did not seem like an acute 
issue, but patient should see dermatologist as an outpatient. 
.
.
# Elevated INR: On admission, INR was noted to be elevated. The 
etiology remained unclear, but was thought to be secondary to 
poor nutritional status. LFTs were checked and were wnl. Since 
the patient needed to go to the OR multiple times, he was given 
vitamin K to prevent bleeding. INR was 1.4 upon discharge.

#HFpEF
#Acute decompensated Heart Failure
Patient presented with dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and a 17 
lb weight gain. The trigger was thought to be hypertension as 
well as confusion about which medications he was supposed to be 
taking. His Lasix dose had recently been reduced as he had been 
losing weight in the setting of recent hospitalization due to a 
UTI and bacteremia. Additionally, his eplerenone was recently 
discontinued per patient. The note from his most recent 
cardiology visit stated that he should be taking Carvedilol, 
losartan, furosemide, and eplerenone. Instead, he was taking 
metoprolol and a lower dose of furosemide as mentioned. No other 
triggers noted such as ischemia, arrhythmogenic, infectious 
etiology or dietary indiscretion. He also presented with SBPs in 
180s-170s. He underwent a TTE that showed an EF of 72% with 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, normal cavity size, 
mildly dilated right ventricle, mild to moderate MR, and 
moderate TR. He was actively Diuresed with Lasix 80 mg IV x 3 
and then switched to Torsemide 40 mg QD. He was started on 
afterload reduction, including amlodipine 10 mg QD and losartan 
that was eventually uptitrated to 50 mg QD. His NHBK included 
metoprolol succinate 50 mg QD. His heart failure regimen upon 
discharge:

He was continued on his home anticoagulation regimen with 
warfarin (6 mg ___, 4 mg ___.

#Speech and swallow
Patient reported having some post-prandial issues with 
swallowing. Speech and swallow evaluated patient and recommended 
video swallow study, which showed silent aspiration with thin 
liquid by straw, no aspiration with thin liquids by cup sips, 
diffuse esophageal retention with solids that would clear with 
liquids. Recommendations were a regular diet with adding 
moisture, thin liquids by cup (no straws), meds one at a time 
with sips by cup, chew well and eat slowly, and alternate solids 
with liquids. Speech and swallow also thought that patient might 
have some esophageal dysmotility.

transiently hypotensive ___ ED, with a fever of 102.7, and 
findings of a new RLL infiltrate concerning for PNA. Responded 
to antibiotics ___ the ED. Other initial considerations for 
causes of SOB were PE, AMI, COPD exacerbation, but PNA 
(parapneumonic effusion vs. empyema) were most likely given 
above. Initial septic picture has resolved. Received 
Vanco/Ceftx/Levofloxcain (day 1 ___ ___ the ED and was 
narrowed to Ceftx/Azithro on arrival to ICU. Pleural fluid cx 
(drawn off pleurex cath) subsequently showed 4+ PMNs and GPCs ___ 
pairs/clusters on gram stain. IP recommended treating this as an 
empyema and adding on Vancomycin (given GPCs ___ clusters).  
Ultimately gram stain and culture of pleural fluid grew 
Corynebacterium diphertheroids and gram stain was modified to 
read GPRs.  
ID was consulted for recommendation on length of treatment given 
indwelling pleurex catheter with no plans to remove likely 
source of infection (given ongoing drainage).  Ms. ___ 
finished a 7 day course of Azithromycin and Ceftriaxone.  CT 
chest w/o contrast showed loculated effusions and she underwent 
TPA/DNAse instilled to pleurex catheter on ___ and ___ to 
attempt to break down these loculations.  While she was 
hospitalized she underwent continuous drainage of the pleurex 
catheter and will require daily drainage (not continuous, but 
instead drainage by bulb) of the catheter at discharge until she 
finishes a total of a 4 week course of Vancomcyin.

Neuro - Pain adequately controlled with dilaudid but when 
enteral access obtained, pain controlled with oral tylenol. With 
agitation, he was treated with valium and seroquel. Pt is 
following commands with antipsychotic medication. In regards to 
his cervical fractures, neurosurgery to cont c-collar for 
cervical fx and will require cervical laminectomy at a later 
date.

Pulm - Attempts at weaning from mechanical ventilation were made 
but patient continued to fail spontaneous breathing trials. He 
was diuresed with lasix to minimize pulmonary edema. 
Bronchoscopy performed due to persistent secretions. Cultures 
returned with pan-sensitive enterobacter from lavage and sputum 
with H.influenza. He was treated with 10 day course of Cipro and 
Ceftriaxone. Due to several attempts of failing extubation, 
decision was to proceed with percutaneous tracheostomy on 
___. He eventually was weaned to trach mask ventilation 
without issue and has remained stable.

Cardio - with issue of CHF, he was kept on aspirin. Continued to 
improve with no pressor requirement and remained hemodynamically 
stable. With agitation, he does become hypertensive, requiring 
occasional hydralazine and lopressor with good effect. Due to 
acute CHF with myocardial dysfunction, he will be continued on 
full dose aspirin. 

GI - While intubated, he was fed with nasogastric tube. 
Percutaneous gastrostomy tube was then placed. Pt was started on 
tube feeds and slowly advanced to goal. His regimen is Replete

Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with type 2 diabetes, 
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, BPH, and three concurrent cancers: 
(1) metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma, s/p radical L 
nephrectomy in ___, found to have pulmonary,
mediastinal, and hilar metastases ___ (now off sunitinib 
without disease progression), (2) metastatic cholangiocarcinoma 
s/p 6 months gem/cisplatin, who subsequently had new (3) acinar 
cell carcinoma of the pancreas, now on ___ I regimen of 
liposomal irinotecan and ___, last dose ___, who went to 
___ clinic with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and was 
found to have possible SBO on KUB.  This led to direct admission 
for workup.  CT abdomen/pelvis with oral contrast showed no 
evidence of bowel obstruction, but showed findings of ileitis, 
as well as increasing pancreatic mass size and new hepatic 
lesions all concerning for progression of his cancer.  While 
hospitalized, he developed recurrent symptoms of nausea, 
vomiting after an initial improvement, and then developed signs 
and symptoms of frank obstruction likely related to his 
pancreatic mass or peritoneal carcinomatosis.  No further 
imaging was pursued.  An NG tube was placed for decompression 
and he had significant improved symptoms.  He subsequently 
underwent palliative venting G-tube is a transition to hospice.

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
# Abdominal pain
# Nausea and vomiting, with malignant obstruction, in setting of 
progressive acinar cell cancer, and large pancreatic mass
# Acinar cell pancreatic cancer
He has been off sutinib as his other cancers are being managed 
and his pulm/hepatic mets have been stable. He is not yet due 
for restaging imaging. He is due for
___, LV, liposomal irinotecan. His oncologists are Dr ___ 
___ Dr ___ seen on ___.  CT abdomen/pelvis showed 
increased size of pancreatic head mass (from 6.0 to 8.0 cm), 
numerous metastatic liver lesions (increased in size and 
number), interval worsening of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, 
and new 3 mm pulmonary nodule in the left lower lobe.  He had 
been having nausea and vomiting likely related to chemo for 
several weeks, but then developed diarrhea, vomiting, and 
abdominal pain the night prior to presentation. His symptoms 
have resolved.  He had 2 watery bowel movements after admission. 
 KUB had showed multiple centrally located distended loops of 
small bowel, concerning for small bowel obstruction.  He has not 
had prior bowel obstruction.  Since he has only 1 kidney with a 
Cr of 1.6, initial CT was done without IV contrast.  CT 
abdomen/pelvis with oral contrast showed no evidence of bowel 
obstruction, but showed wall thickening of distal and terminal 
ileum with adjacent fat stranding, compatible with infectious or 
inflammatory ileitis.  Since he was afebrile with improved 
symptoms, empiric antibiotics were not started.  C. difficile 
was negative as was ecoli.   He was initially treated with bowel 
rest and IV fluids, then diet was advanced.  The CT scan also 
showed increasing size of pancreatic mass, enlarging and new 
hepatic lesions, new left lung nodule, worsening retroperitoneal 
lymphadenopathy, all concerning for progression of disease.   
Given this new complication of his pancreatic cancer, family 
meeting was held on ___, with a decision to pursue hospice 
care at home given no other therapeutic options.  His prognosis 
was given as weeks.  He was transitioned to liquid concentrated 
morphine for pain, as well as lorazepam for anxiety, and 
dexamethasone for nausea.  Oral medications were given after his 
PEG was placed, with clear instructions on how to take them.  
This included dexamethasone, concentrated morphine, and 
olanzapine.  Other home medications were continued at this time, 
with decisions to stop these medications going forward to occur 
with hospice services and Dr. ___, patient's 
oncologist.  MOLST form was completed.

# Acute on chronic anemia: Baseline hemoglobin is ___.  
Hemoglobin was low at 6.7 on ___, so he was transfused 1 unit 
PRBCs with improvement to 8.3.  He had no obvious signs of acute 
blood loss anemia and stool has not appeared grossly bloody or 
signs of melena evident.  His blood count remained stable.  Labs 
were not checked after goals of care were changed.

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS:
# Chronic kidney disease: Creatinine is 1.4-1.6 at baseline.  He 
had recent ___ with Cr of 2.2 on ___ and 1.8 on admission, 
likely due to dehydration. Renal function returned to baseline 
after getting IV fluids then rose after he likely developed 
recurrent dehydration.  As stated above labs were not rechecked 
after goals of care change.

# History of Portal Vein Thrombus: He was continued on home 
Rivaroxaban 10mg daily, except for initially being held while 
NPO.  This was continued for now, but should be stopped if 
decided not consistent with comfort going forward.

# Severe protein-calorie malnutrition: He has low albumin and 
reported low oral intake due to nausea, vomiting, and abdominal 
pain, which has been ongoing off/on for weeks, likely due to 
chemo and his known cancers.  Consulted nutrition who 
recommended low fiber diet with Ensure Clear early in 
hospitalization, but given transition to hospice, he was 
recommended to have diet as tolerated.

# Type 2 diabetes: His glargine was initially decreased while 
NPO on IV D5LR, then stopped and treated with sliding scale 
insulin only and Glipizide was held.  On discharge, glipizide 
was continued.

fulminant hepatic failure thought to be due to autoimmune 
hepatitis, post transplant course c/b multiple episodes of 
rejection (___) and biliary stricture s/p 
stent,
which was removed ___, presenting with 10 days of nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain, concerning for infection.

1. Invasive CMV infection, C diff colitis 
Patient presented with 10 days of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. 
Patient with multiple risk factors for infection, including 
recent liver transplant with CMV positive donor CMV negative 
recipient, immunocompromised status in the setting of liver 
transplant, and recent antibiotic course (amoxicillin) about 10 
days prior to admission. CT A/P without evidence of infection. 
Stool studies were sent and were significant for positive C diff 
toxin (and PCR). CMV viral load was sent which returned positive 
at 3.7. Of note patient has never been treated for C diff and 
has never had a positive CMV viral load on prior testing. 
Transplant infectious disease was consulted who felt patient's 
clinical picture was possibly consistent with tissue invasive 
CMV. The decision was made to treat empirically for invasive 
disease and colonoscopy with biopsy was deferred. Patient was 
initiated on oral Vancomycin on ___ for a planned ___nd IV ganciclovir on ___ for a planned 3 week course. 
Patient's tacrolimus level was monitored with dosing adjusted as 
below for goal tacro level of approximately 8. Patient's MMF 
dose was decreased to 540 mg PO BID given active infection. 
Patient's nausea was managed with PRN Ativan and compazine. 
Patient will follow up with both transplant ID and transplant 
surgery as outpatient for monitoring of infection, management of 
immunosuppressive medications and possible initiation of 
secondary CMV prophylaxis.

2. Immunosuppressive monitoring
Patient with history of likely autoimmune hepatitis s/p liver 
tranplant with numerous episodes of rejection on tacrolimus, MMF 
and prednisone for immunosuppresion. While in the hospital, 
tacrolimus levels were monitored with dose decreased from 3 mg 
BID to 2 mg BID with goal tacrolimus level of ~8. MMF dose was 
decreased from 720 mg BID to ___ mg BID. Prednisone was 
continued at 5 mg daily. 

3. Concern for Biliary stricture
Patient underwent CT A/P due to concern for intrabdominal 
infection. CT without evidence of infection, but with 
nonspecific biliary dilation, CBD up to 0.8 cm. Given normal 
LFTs, it was felt that this finding was unrelated to her current 
admission and the decision was made to defer ERCP. Consider 
follow up imaging after resolution of her acute infection. 

4. Concern for malnutrition
There was concern for possible malnutrition given prolonged GI 
illness. Electrolytes were monitored and repleted as needed with 
nutrition consulted and providing diet recommendations.

gram negative coverage including pseudomonas.  The patient had 
no clear signs of infection on exam, had a negative UA, a 
negative CXR, and a negative CT chest/abdomen/pelvis.  The 
patient's WBC count decreased from 1.3 to 1.0 in under 24 hours 
(ANC 854 to 640).  He was also pancytopenic.  After discussing 
with the patient's oncology team, we administered a single dose 
of neupogen. We continued to monitor vitals and CBC levels 
closely.  His ANC elevated to 1200 on hospital day 2.  He also 
had 2 documented fevers to 100.8F. Since his ANC elevated, the 
patient was feeling better, and has very good follow up plan, he 
was discharge to home.  He was instructed to take his 
temperatures q8h at home and after any chills.  Blood cultures 
were pending upon discharge.  He will follow up at his local 
hospital in ___ to check a CBC on ___ and the 
results will be sent to the ___.  Depending on the CBC 
results, he will receive a dose of neupogen as needed.  

# Acute renal failure: Creatinine levels were elevated at 1.3 
from baseline normal. After administration of IV fluids, 
creatinine normalized indicating volume depletion likely from 
decreased po intake.  His creatinine levels increased on HD 2 
and we administered IV fluids before discharge and instructed 
him to remain hydrated at home. 

# Elevated LFTs: the increase was moderate, yet new. According 
to his experimental chemotherapy study team, elevated LFTs are 
not a common side effect of this medication.  There was no 
change in appearance of the liver on CT abdomen compared to 
previous imaging. We felt that this elevation was secondary to 
the medication since his LFTs appeared to be trending up after 
initiation of this treatment. We monitored his LFTs daily and 
held the medication during his stay. 
 
# Metastatic melanoma: the patient is currently on an 
experimental chemotherapy protocol. We discussed his care with 
his oncology team.  As above, he received one dose of neupogen 
for neutropenia that was likely due to the experimental 
medication.  His oncology team will follow up with him next 
week.  

# Oral thrush: the patient had white plaque on his gingiva. It 
was unlikely to be systemic. We treated him with nystatin oral 
rinse. 

# Pain control: we continued administering his outpatient 
regimen. The patient did not require additional dosing. 

# Anxiety: we continued administering his home medication 
lorazepam for sleep.

and ALT/AST. Increased INR at 1.2 but this is stable. Thought to 
be due to combination of recently increased narcotics, 
hyponatremia, and liver dysfunction. Oxycontin regimen was 
re-dosed across 3 split doses (10 mg TID) before discharge and 
was tolerating this pain regimen without signs/symptoms of 
alterned mental statis. hyponatremia improved with fluid 
restriction and diuresis with home lasix. Patient was started on 
lactulose as well. 

# encephalopathy - Patient with several days of 
confusion/hallucinations/slow mentation. Initially unclear 
etiology. Not infection as no fevers or chills or localizing 
symptoms and lack of leukocytosis. ___ be due to increasing 
liver dysfunction but patient with normal bilirubin and ALT/AST. 
Increased INR at 1.2 but this is stable. Patient Hyponatremia 
unlikely cause. In terms of medications, patient's oxycontin was 
increased to 30mg BID which likely preciptated the change seen. 
His medicaiton regimen was re-titrated slowly in conjunction 
with palliative care until a new balance was found keeping him 
pain free and with normal mentation.

# hyponatremia - patient with sodium of 126 on admission, where 
it has been recently. ___ be secondary to fluid overload. No 
signs of lung involvment or SIADH. Placed on 1500cc fluid 
restriction, continue home lasix, daily chem7.

for SCC (p/o day 21) who was found to be in new-onset HFrEF 
thought to be due to coronary disease, found to have 3VD now 
called out of the CCU after diuresis and cardiac cath, with 
further management TBD.

Acute medical/surgical issues addressed
#Hypoxia
#New-Onset HFrEF: Developed hypoxemia and lower extremity edema 
with CXR demonstrating bilateral pulmonary edema and pleural 
effusions. BNP elevated to 18,000, troponins elevated with peak 
at 0.61, and nonspecific T wave changes in precordial leads on 
ECG. Cardiology consulted, felt new heart failure due to missed 
infarct, was transferred to medicine service for further 
management. Medicine service attempted diuresis with IV Lasix 
but was limited by ___. He was transferred to cardiology on 
___. ___ improved and diuresis was again attempted. His TTE 
demonstrated newly depressed EF of 43% from prior normal EF on 
ECHO during this hospitalization, with regional 
dysfunction/apical hypokinesis c/f CAD and LAD territory. On 
___ he developed new onset hypoxia concerning for worsening 
edema and possible progression of his underlying CAD. Etiology 
unclear- inadequate diuresis vs aspiration on NG tube feeds vs 
potential for new MI vs PNA given elevated WBC. He was started 
on Lasix and nitro drips and transferred to the CCU after 
continued hypoxia for further management. He was started on 
heparin gtt for apical hypokinesis. In the CCU, he was weaned 
off of his nitro gtt. His Lasix gtt was discontinued on ___. 
Cardiac cath performed on ___ showed triple vessel disease. 
Patient was transitioned back to cardiology following 
catheterization. Patient was started on metoprolol that was 
uptitrated to 25mg Q6hrs. Patient was also started on po Lasix 
40mg. Heparin gtt was started for for apical hypokinesis and 
atrial fibrillation and was transitioned to Xarelto before 
discharge.

#NSTEMI: Pt with new regional dysfunction on echo c/f CAD with 
troponin elevation meeting criteria for NSTEMI. The patient was 
continued on aspirin 81, atorvastatin 80. His home metoprolol 
and acei were held initially in the setting of nitro gtt. 
Metoprolol was restarted in setting of atrial fibrillation and 
he was discharged on 25mg Q6hrs. ACEI was not restarted and will 
need to be followed as an outpatient. 

#Atrial fibrillation: New diagnosis. The patient was found to be 
in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response on ___. 
This was thought to be due to ___, and the patient's 
rhythm converted back to sinus rhythm after metoprolol 5mg IV 
and 1LNS. The patient was started on metoprolol 6.25mg q6hrs, 
and was discharged on 25 mg Q6h. The patient's CHA2DS2-VASc 
score indicated high risk for thromboembolism, so patient was 
continued on heparin gtt. The patient was bridged to and 
discharged on Xarelto.

# Leukocytosis: continues to have mildly elevated WBC. Denies 
any fevers or chills. Wound culture final results are positive 
for MSSA. After discussions with ENT, they do not believe that 
the trach site has an infection and that the fluid that was 
culutured was likely ___ to respiratory secretions coming 
through the trach site. No clinical signs of PNA and CXR 
yesterday negative for PNA. Will hold off on treating at this 
time. Urine yesterday was cloudy. Foley was removed and urine 
sent for UA and culture. UA concerning for possible CAUTI.
Patient was started on Keflex ___ BID while awaiting final 
urine culture. He will finish a 10 day course on ___.

#SCC s/p Head and Neck Reconstruction: Admitted to the plastic 
surgery service on ___ with white oral squamous cell 
carcinoma now s/p resection of right mandible, maxilla and soft 
tissue receiving a free VRAM from the left and abdomen and 
requiring a small STSG from the right thigh. Post-operatively, 
the patient was monitored in the ICU and transferred to the 
floor on POD#2 after ambulating. Since then, the patient began 
experiencing delirium in the evenings, likely exacerbated by 
lack of sleep. Seroquel was used for delirium prophylaxis; 
however, he still required haloperidol several evenings, and he 
would pull his tubes and drains. In addition, his Dobhoff was 
clogged on POD#9, which was later replaced on POD#10 
(___). 

# ___, resolved: Cr increased to 1.5 during hospitalization 
(baseline 0.9-1.1), which was thought to be due to ___, 
___ however represent poor forward flow. The Cr eventually 
downtrended to 1.0 on discharge. His medications were renally 
dosed throughout his hospital admission. 

#DELIRIUM: Resolved. Mental status currently waxing and waning 
but stable at the time of discharge.

# Hypernatremia, resolved: occurred while patient was NPO before 
cardiac cath. Resolved following restarting free water flushes.

antibiotics were given per standard protocol. Initial postop 
pain was controlled with a PCA. On HD#2 she returned to the 
operating room for a scheduled T10-S1 decompression with PSIF as 
part of a staged 2-part procedure.  The posterior surgery was 
staged over two days due to large intraop bleeding and she was 
transfererd to the SICU. Please refer to the dictated operative 
note for further details. The second surgery was also without 
complication and the patient was transferred to the PACU in a 
stable condition. Postoperative HCT was low and she was 
transfused PRBCs with good effect. A bupivicaine epidural pain 
catheter placed at the time of the posterior surgery remained in 
place until postop day one when it was removed. She was kept NPO 
until bowel function returned then diet was advanced as 
tolerated. The patient was transitioned to oral pain medication 
when tolerating PO diet. Foley was removed on POD#2 from the 
second procedure. She was fitted with a TLSO brace for 
ambulation. Physical therapy was consulted for mobilization OOB 
to ambulate. Hospital course was otherwise unremarkable. On the

SAFETY:  The pt. was placed on constant observation due to fall 
risk and dysregulated behavior.  She remained on that level of 
observation throughout.  She was unit-restricted.  There were no 
acute safety issues during this hospitalization.

LEGAL: ___
PSYCHIATRIC:
Ms. ___ was admitted from her nursing home for increasingly 
bizarre and agitated behavior. Upon admission to the inpatient 
psychiatric unit, she continued to demonstrate inappropriate 
verbal content, lability, and unpredictable behavior. Her 
presentation is most consistent with a decompensation of her 
schizoaffective disorder. While on the inpatient medicine 
service, she received a total of 9 ECT treatments and was noted 
to be less agitated and verbally inappropriate than at the time 
of her admission to the hospital. When transferred to the 
inpatient psychiatric unit on ___, she was continued on 
ECT biweekly ___ and ___. Mrs. ___ was continued on 
ClonazePAM 1 mg BID, Seroquel 150 mg BID, valproex (DELayed 
Release) 250 mg BID, and Zydis 2.5 mg PO DAILY:PRN severe 
agitation. On ___, Seroquel was increased to 200mg BID (AM & 
QHS) and 100mg 2PM. On ___, Seroquel was increased to 300mg BID 
(AM & QHS) and 100mg 2PM. Divalproex was increased to 750mg QHS. 


Upon admission to the psychiatric unit, Mrs. ___ was 
experiencing disturbed sleep, outbursts with agitation, and a 
dysregulation of behavior. She had multiple episodes of 
incontinence, verbally inappropriate with staff, and would 
respond with persecutory statements that were incongruent on 
interview. She was maintained on constant observation due to her 
unpredictable behavior. She was compliant with medication and 
ECT treatments and through the course of her admission she 
responded well to these interventions. Her affect brightened and 
she was increasingly interactive with the staff. Her behavior 
was less volatile and she speech less inappropriate. She was 
able to sit up in her chair and engage more appropriately with 
staff. Over the course of her admission, the team was in contact 
with the patient's long term guardian. She was instrumental in 
assessing Mrs. ___ improvement toward baseline. Mrs. ___ 
continued to improve and was determined safe for discharge back 
to the ___. 

GENERAL MEDICAL CONDITIONS:
# CAD: Stable. Continued on home ASA, statin, and beta blocker.

# Nutrition:  Patient has a PEG tube in place for feeding and 
medication due to history of multiple catatonic episodes and 
inability to swallow. Tube feeds were not required during 
admission. They were properly flushed daily. 

PSYCHOSOCIAL:
#) GROUPS/MILIEU: Due to ongoing psychosis and unpredictable 
behavior, the patient was not appropriate for groups.  She was 
seen by OT daily for individual intervention including coloring, 
reading magazines. However, Mrs. ___ had little interest in 
these activities. She was often walked with staff and would 
reside near the day room providing the ability for her to 
interact with other patients and staff. 

#) COLLATERAL CONTACTS:
The pt's legal guardian, Ms. ___, was in contact with 
the inpatient team throughout Mrs. ___ admission. She 
shared more of pt's history with the team. She noted that pt had 
seemed to be doing well as long as she was receiving ECT. 
However, there has been a significant decline in the past ___ 
years after her last hospitalization. She was maintained on ECT 
until there was no significant improvement before or after her 
ECT treatment and it was elected to discontinue. This was a 
couple months prior to admission. At the end of ___, Ms. 
___ and the ___ staff started noticing pt was 
becoming more verbally aggressive and acting differently.  Ms. 
___ said she did not feel pt was at baseline but was hopeful 
that the ECT might help. 

Pt's outpatient prescriber (PCP) was contacted. Dr. ___ 
___, MD (___. He sees the pt at her nursing 
home and has been prescribing her medications including her 
psychiatric medications. He said that after her episode of 
catatonia she was doing well only on benzodiazepines and ECT. 
Eventually ECT was discontinued and she began acting up and not 
doing well psychiatrically. He recently started her on Seroquel 
with the intention to titrate the dose up. 

#) FAMILY INVOLVEMENT:
The pt has multiple siblings with whom she is close.  During her 
admission, she was visited by her brother who lives ___. He 
did want to be part of a family meeting and deferred decision 
making to her legal guardian. 

#) INTERVENTIONS:
 - Medications: pt's psychiatric medications were adjusted 
during her admission
 - ECT: pt received ECT weekly 
 - Psychotherapeutic Interventions: Individual and milieu 
therapy.
 - Coordination of aftercare: pt will return to the ___ 
___ 

INFORMED CONSENT:
The team discussed the indications for, intended benefits of, 
and possible side effects and risks of starting these 
medications, and risks and benefits of possible alternatives, 
including not taking the medication, with this patient.  We 
discussed the patient's right to decide whether to take this 
medication as well as the importance of the patient's actively 
participating in the treatment and discussing any questions 
about medications with the treatment team, and all questions 
were appropriately answered. 

RISK ASSESSMENT:
#) Chronic/Static Risk Factors:
- Chronic mental illness, multiple psychiatric hospitalizations, 
history of catatonia, nursing home dependent, chronic medical 
illness

#) Modifiable Risk Factors:
- Psychosis:  This risk was mitigated this by treating the 
patient with ECT and  increasing her psychiatric medications.  
She tolerated therapies well and was much improved at time of 
discharge 

#) Protective Factors:
- Stable housing - pt is a long time resident of the ___ 
___, she is well liked there and has a good rapport with staff
- Legal guardian - pt has a legal guardian with whom she has a 
positive relationship, the guardian has been very active in her 
care and well being

PROGNOSIS:
Guarded - Mrs. ___ is prone to relapse given her long history 
of mental illness, multiple psychiatric admission, and noted 
mental health decline.

Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization.

GI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially provided sips 
post-operatively. He passed flatus on POD #1, therefore, the 
diet was advanced sequentially to a regular diet. He experienced 
some nausea and belching on POD #2, thus he was backed down to 
clears. He was then re-advanced to a regular diet, which was 
well tolerated. Patient's intake and output were closely 
monitored. He was bladder scanned every shift. He was found to 
be retaining >400 cc urine, thus a Foley was placed on POD #0. 
He was started on Flomax on POD #1. His Foley was discontinued 
on POD #2 and he voided independently and made good amounts of 
urine during this hospitalization with low post-void residuals. 
He was discharged with an abdominal JP drain in place.

ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of 
infection, of which there were none.

HEME: The patient's blood counts were closely watched for signs 
of bleeding, of which there were none.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and 
venodyne boots were used during this stay. He was encouraged to 
get up and ambulate as early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable. The patient was tolerating a diet, 
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled. The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan. He declined home ___ services 
as he felt comfortable taking care of his JP drain on his own.

episodes of small amounts of nonbloody emesis after her biopsy 
procedure, her abdominal pain has subsided to her baseline and 
her condition has improved.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
.
#Colitis: The potential causes of her RLQ pain include 
infectious colitis, exacerbation of an underlying inflammatory 
process, irritation of her mesenteric mass, or diverticulitis. 
Her lactate was elevated to 3.1 on admission, but it is trended 
down to 1.8; she likely had some decreased perfusion which 
appears to have resolved. Her abdominal CT showed fat stranding 
c/w inflammation or infection. Her WBC was 12.8 on admission but 
trended down to 7.3, and she has had no further fevers. Her GI 
rec by Dr. ___ that fat malabsorption, idiopathic 
inflammatory bowel disease, or 
microscopic/collagenous/lymphocytic colitis have all been 
previously worked up and found to be negative, so there was no 
further need for those studies here today. Her RLQ pain largely 
improved and her condition was stable. She was treated with 
flagyl and cipro to cover for possible infectious process prior 
to her biopsy surgery.
.
#Right iliac lymphadenopathy: MR ___ on ___ and 
Abd/Pelvis CT on ___ showed evidence of R iliac 
lymphadenopathy (as well as a soft tissue mesenteric mass), for 
which she was scheduled to receive a biopsy with Dr. ___. 
Her biopsy procedure on ___ went without complications, and 
post-op she had a low-grade fever at one point which then 
resolved. She c/o occasional nausea and had some vomiting likely 
___ being post-op, but was passing gas and had loose stool that 
was consistent with the loose stools she has been having for the 
past year. She is currently afebrile and stable. 
.
#UTI: She had a positive UA and urine culture growing E coli and 
Klebsiella both sensitive to cipro. The pt remained asymptomatic 
and denied dysuria, frequency, or burning upon urination. The E 
coli and Klebsiella would have been covered by the cipro as 
administered for her colitis, although her UTI is asymptomatic 
and would not merit treatment on its own as per ___ guidelines.
.
#Elevated WBC: Her WBC was 12.8 on admission but trended down to 
9.0 over the course of several days; the high value was likely 
in the context of her colitis.
.
INACTIVE ISSUES:
.
#DM: We held her home medications and kept her on an ISS; she 
was discharged on her home medication regimen.
.
#Depression and anxiety: We held her Venlafaxine, and continued 
her clonazepam. Prior to her surgery she felt anxious, and was 
given 1mg of ativan once. Otherwise, her condition was stable.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

The patient with biopsy proven metastatic neuroendocrine tumor 
was admitted to the HPB Surgical Service for elective surgical 
resection. On ___, the patient underwent exploratory 
laparotomy, extended radical distal pancreatectomy and 
splenectomy and wedge resection of segment 5 liver metastasis, 
which went well without complication (reader referred to the 
Operative Note for details). In the PACU patient was given 2 
units of pRBC for HCT 23, post transfusion HCT was 29.9. The 
patient arrived on the floor NPO, on IV fluids, with a foley 
catheter, and epidural catheter for pain control.  The patient 
was hemodynamically stable.
Neuro: The patient received Dilaudid/Bupivacaine with good 
effect and adequate pain control. On POD # 1 patient became 
hallucinating and agitated and soft restrains were apply. The 
patient self discontinued his NGT on POD # 2. He received IV 
Haldol per ACS service and started on Trazodone per Geriatric 
team recs. The patient's delirium cleared on POD # 4 and he 
remained stable from neurological standpoint prior discharge. 
When tolerating oral intake, the patient was transitioned to 
oral pain medications.
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization. He developed subcutaneous 
emphysema post operatively and chest radiograph was obtained to 
rule out pneumothorax and was negative.
GI: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV fluids. 
Diet was advanced when appropriate, which was well tolerated.  
Patient's intake and output were closely monitored, and IV fluid 
was adjusted when necessary.  Electrolytes were routinely 
followed, and repleted when necessary. JP drain was removed on 
POD # 7 as output and JP amylase were low.
Liver: Transplant service continued to follow the patient post 
operatively. LFTs returned within normal limits prior discharge. 

ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were 
closely watched for signs of infection. Wound was evaluated 
daily, no signs and symptoms of infection were noticed. Staples 
were removed prior discharge and steri strips were applied.   
Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout 
his stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly. Home dose 
Metformin was restarted when tolerated regular diet. The 
patient's ___ was slightly above normal limits in the morning 
only, and Metformin dose was increased. The patient instructed 
to follow up with PCP and ___ services ordered to check blood 
glucose daily.  
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined 
routinely; no further transfusions were required. 
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and 
venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible. Prior discharge patient 
underwent RLE US to rule out DVT. US was negative, the patient 
had +1 pitted edema, he was recommended to keep his feet 
elevated while asleep and follow up with PCP if swelling ___ 
continue to progress.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular 
diabetic diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain 
was well controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching 
and follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and

Ms. ___ is a ___ with history of Alzheimer's disease, COPD, 
recurrent DVT/PE, HTN, and rheumatoid arthritis was transferred 
from OSH for recurrent PE in the setting of a supratherapeutic 
INR concerning for anticoagulation failure. On admission, the 
patient was hemodynamically stable on room air. TTE without 
evidence of right heart strain and LENIs reassuringly negative. 
Per heme-onc, given clot formation with INR 5, there is concern 
for underlying malignancy. Of note, the patient has severe 
dementia and after discussion with the daughter regarding goals 
of care, it was clear that the patient would like to minimize 
invasive testing or interventions. A CT abdomen/pelvis was 
performed as a low-risk assessment of mass, which was 
reassuringly normal. Will plan to follow-up with her primary 
care provider for consideration of mammogram. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
==============
#Recurrent PE: Original PE/DVT diagnosed in ___ on warfarin. 
Developed recurrent PE despite an INR of 5.3 raising concern for 
underlying malignancy. Fortunately, patient remained 
hemodynamically stable on room air. TTE without evidence of 
right heart strain and troponin negative. LENIs negative. Per 
Heme-onc, no utility for IVC filter. After discussion with 
daughter, she would like to minimize invasive testing/treatment. 
Agreed with CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis because if malignancy 
was discovered, she would like this knowledge in order to guide 
palliative efforts and NOT to pursue aggressive treatment. 
Fortunately, her CT abdomen/pelvis was negative for mass. Given 
clinical stability, the patient was discharged home with her 
daughter with plans to follow-up with her PCP for further 
management and consideration of mammogram.

___: Likely secondary to poor PO intake in the hospital in the 
setting of underlying dementia. No signs of infection and 
patient was voiding without difficulty making obstruction less 
likely. Given 1L gentle IVF on ___bdomen/pelvis 
with mild improvement to 1.2 upon discharge.

#RUQ Pain: Likely referred pain from underlying PE. Abdominal 
examination benign and LFTs unremarkable. Managed PE as detailed 
above. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
================
#Severe Alzheimer's Dementia: short-term memory loss, with mood 
swings and irritability. Continued home Memantine.

#HTN: continued home amlodipine

#RA: continued home gabapentin

#COPD: continued home inhalers

Pt presented with 3 weeks of lower back pain after he left his 
rehab facility AMA when rehab was only giving him half of his 
high dose narcotic medications. Was self-medicating with up to 
15 tablets of ASA/day at home without relief. Initially 
presented to OSH with increasing lower back pain, and 
transferred here since he has received his past osteomyelitis 
care and work-up here.

1. Lumbar Back Pain: Pt with ___ admission from ___ 
for discitis/osteomyelitis, epidural abscess, psoas abscess 
treated with 10 wks of abx (8 weeks IV vanco and 2 weeks po 
levoflox), with most recent CT ab/pelvis showing resolution of 
psoas abscess. On arrival to ___, patient was afebrile, with 
normal WBC count. No danger signs of saddle anesthesia, 
weakness, bladder retention, incontinence. Repeat MRI showed 
L3-L4 and L4-L5 persistent discitis with degenerative changes, 
but no new epidural abscess. Was initially treated with 
vancomycin, which was then discontinued after one dose, as 
Infectious Disease felt there was no indication to treat with 
antibiotics. Neurosurgery was consulted, and felt no need for 
surgical intervention. Patient may follow up with Dr. ___ 
neurosurgery as an outpatient if he feels the need to see 
neurosurgery, though discitis inflammation pain is likely to 
improve over the next 6 months. 

2. Pain control: Patient left rehab 3 weeks ago AMA as he felt 
his pain was not adequately being treated, and was 
self-medicating at home with high doses aspirin without relief. 
On this admission, given normal MRI and lack of infectious 
identifiable cause, back pain was ultimately thought to be 
secondary to degenerative changes of discitis. Patient was 
evaluated by physical therapy, and patient was provided with a 
cane which assisted him with his walking. Was restarted on pain 
regimen at lower doses from past admission, with oxycontin 40mg 
bid, oxycodone 20mg q4 hours prn, and tylenol 1 mg q8. Was also 
started on neurontin 300 mg BID, which patient tolerated well. 
Patient was discharged on this regimen for an ___nd 
was instructed to follow-up with his PCP within the next 1 week 
to manage pain control and create a pain contract. Patient 
states he does not see his PCP regularly, and so contact 
information for ___ was also provided, 
as outpatient follow-up of his pain regimen will be crucial.

___ hx Stage III squamous cell ca of the lung, schizophrenia, 
gerd, hypothyroid and esophagitis. Patient presented acutely 
with complaints of urinary retention penile pain, as well as 
decompensated schizophrenia. 

Decompensated Schizophrenia
-Initially evaluated in the ER by psychiatry and identified him 
with decompensated schizophrenia; recommended for admission to 
Hospital Medicine due to urinary retention.
-Discussion with Psychiatry following re-evaluation found him to 
be with worsening decompensated schizophrenia. This is evidenced 
by non-linear thoughts, refusal of interventions and 
consultations due to paranoia. Appreciate their involvement with
his care. He will transfer to inpatient psychiatry unit today. 
Risperidone and Aripiprazole ordered; refusing risperidone based 
on shape/color of pills available here. Additionally refusing 
his aripiprazole. Paranoia was clearly evident with persistent 
evasiveness and refusal of interventions throughout his hospital 
course. His current mentation remains as his primary barrier to 
achievement of therapeutic goals; feel that the patient 
currently lacks capacity to make sound medical decisions
In case discussion with Psychiatry, felt that he would benefit 
from transfer to inpatient psychiatric service in order to 
address his schizophrenia as this is impeding any potential 
progress for his other chronic medical conditions, i.e. urinary 
retention with suspected BPH, hypothyroidism, follow-up care for 
his pulmonary malignancy.

Urinary retention
Post obstructive uropathy / Probable BPH
-Responded well to intermittent catheterization. Continues to 
require intermittent catheterization; ordered q8h; volume of 
output stable and decreasing. Suspect that tamsulosin is now 
taking effect as this is the only medication he has consistently 
been taking. Continue with tamsulosin. Patient refusing Urology 
consultation; once mentation addressed and stabilized, recommend 
consultation due to suspicion for probable BPH. Initially 
thought to be linked to his psychotropic medications
however he has not been taking his medications as an outpatient 
or here in the hospital, hence suspicion for BPH.

CPPD, crystalline arthropathy of R knee
R Knee Effusion
-Orthopaedics consulted for assistance with synovial fluid 
aspiration. Synovial fluid analysis consistent with pseudogout. 
Continue with PO motrin daily for the next 5 days; limited 
efficacy of longterm colchicine for CPPD. Would plan on staying 
on NSAIDs for this. After next 5 days would use TID PRN. 
Appreciate Orthopaedic's involvement with his care.

Hypothyroid 
- Ordered for levothyroxine 100 mcg daily; patient refusing. TSH 
markedly elevated but without overt features of decompensated 
hypothyroidism at this point. Likely secondary to not taking 
medication over indeterminate duration of time.

GERD, Esophagitis
- Ordered pantoprazole; patient refusing

Lung Cancer 
- s/p chemo/rads, outpatient follow up; poor outpatient 
follow-up compliance. Not an active issue during this 
hospitalization.

PSYCHIATRIC

#Depression)On admission, patient was acutely agitated and felt 
that she did not need inpatient psychiatric care. However, she 
descalated during first 24hrs and agreed that she needed to be 
on the unit for her safety, as she continued to endorse suicidal 
ideation with plan for CO poisoning if she were home. 

During hospitalization, she was medically cleared for ECT and 
underwent first treatment on ___, with some resulting headache 
and backache, for which she was subsequently pre-medicated 
before each next treatment, with no further symptoms. 
Additionally, she was continued on her home klonopin, 
methylphenidate, and venlafaxine. Home seroquel (for sleep) and 
lithium were discontinued in setting of risks (metabolic 
syndrome) / thyroid problems/ weight problems > benefits, 
without any complications. Her mood improved steadily over the 
course of treatment, and the patient developed better insight 
into the origin of her psychiatric symptoms.  She had a total of 
10 ECT tx.  

On discharge, mood was ""better"", MSE was pertinent for much 
brighter affect along with increased capacity to show insight 
into sources of her depression and some of her own ambivalence 
toward recovery.  Safety: The patient remained in good 
behavioral control throughout this hospitalization and did not 
require physical or chemical restraint. The patient remained on 
15 minute checks, which is our lowest acuity level of checks.

frequently had conversations with his/her peers. He/She attended 
some groups. He/She never engaged in any unsafe behaviors. The 
pt ate all meals in the milieu, slept well, and cooperated with 
unit rules.

#) FAMILY CONTACTS
Family meeting was held with the patient's aunt mid-way through 
admission and was notable for the pt being superficially bright 
and the aunt being concerned that pt was not allowing herself to 
genuinely feel emotion, even if negative.  We worked w/the pt on 
introducing some stress into her hospital life to make it less 
of a 'vacation' and more as an ongoing therapy.  She was 
resistant to this idea but did work w/ the team toward allowing 
some fuller range of emotions to be expressed, including intense 
feelings about her parents and self.

RISK ASSESSMENT:
Ms. ___ has a low risk of harm to self/others.

Chronic RF include; h/o SI w/ plan; h/o depression; caucasian 
race; closure of adoption case w/ ___ leaving patient as a 
childless woman

Modifiable RF are; depression (which we tx with ECT and 
medication), social supports lacking (we arranged for a partial 
hospital program to increase supports and pt's mother came to 
town to stay with her during recovery), unemployment (pt has 
been making strides in considering returning to the workforce 
and is highly accomplished and capable of doing so). 

Protective factors are; lack of violence hx, sobriety, lack of 
previous suicide attempt, good relationship with aunt and 
sister-in-law and niece, and friend network.  Pt currently 
denies si and is highly motivated and future oriented.

possible side effects and risks of this medication, and risks 
and benefits of possible alternatives, including not taking the 
medication, with this patient.  We discussed the patient's right 
to decide whether to take this medication as well as the 
importance of the patient's actively participating in the 
treatment and discussing any questions about medications with 
the treatment team, and I answered the patient's questions.  The 
patient appeared able to understand and consented to begin the 
medication.

sensory symptoms of the arm only. Similarly, it is less likely 
to be a peripheral nerve or plexus problem given its involvement 
of the entire arm. Electrolytes were normal. CXR excluded mass 
lesion or trauma which makes thoracic outlet syndrome less 
likely. She was admitted for TIA work-up. Her MRI did not show

and history of UTIs, presents with dysuria and increased 
frequency in the setting of failed outpatient therapy with 
Ciprofloxacin.

#. UTI - On admission, UA was noted to be positive though she 
had been on cipro and tetracycline as an outpatient. She was 
symptomatic, complaining of burning and suprapubic pain, there 
was no CVA tenderness. She reported fever to 101 at home but was 
afebrile on admission and ___ hospital stay. She was 
treated initially with IV ceftriaxone. UCX grew mixed flora

originally scheduled to see Dr. ___ in urology at ___ on Hospital 
Day# 2. Patient and family requested an expedited evaluation by 
urology, if possible during the admission. The team offered to 
expedite the outpatient evaluation, but did not feel that 
inpatient consultation would be indicated given the active 
urinary tract infection and no evidence of acute obstruction of 
the urinary tract. This was discussed at length with the family, 
and their questions were addressed. An expedited appointment was 
made for the patient, with Dr ___ soon after the patient 
would complete the course of antibiotics.

# L>R leg swelling - patient is s/p bilateral fem-pop bipass 
which was regarded as most likely explanation of her chornic

This is a ___ year-old gentleman presented with exertional chest 
pain, decreased appetite and weight loss over past 3 months and 
dizziness. Of note pt is a poor historian and required several 
translators and the story changed frequently 

# Dyspepsia: EKG unchanged compared to prior and trop as high as 
0.04 and went down to 0.02. He had stress test (stress MIBI) 
which was essentially normal though was suboptimal bc pt did not 
reach exersize capacity bc of dizziness. Pt with epigastric 
tenderness and prior EGD in ___ showing gastritis and has been 
on omeprazole since. Differential diagnosis included gastitis vs 
PUD. Dose of omeprazole was increased from 20 to 40mg daily and 
he was given Maalox/Diphenhydramine/Lidocaine 15 mL PO TID for 
his symptoms. H Pylori antigen test also sent (still pending at 
discharge). Depending on the results we will either treat his 
H.pylori or try a higher dose of omeprazole as a drug trial. PCP 
was emailed about hospital course and about following up with H 
pylori results. 
 
# Decreased appetitite/weight loss/Dizziness: Decr appetite over 
past few months, no diarrhea, worse recently. Symptoms likely 
related to gastritis vs PUD which can cause decreased appetite. 
Adrenal insufficiency was ruled out with am cortisol wnl. 
Additional labs were drawn including: B12 876 wnl, ALb 4.1, TSH 
4.6 TIBC 259 ferritin 417  tot protein 6.8 AFP 1.4  MM/MGUS was 
also on differential in a pt with elevated Cr (baseline Cr about 
1.6) and low Ht. This was not worked up during hospital stay 
though PCP was emailed about following up with this workup. 
Dizziness appears to be most likely related to peripheral 
neuropathy - potentially related to his diabetes given nl B12, 
folate supplementation and a prior negative HIV Ab. 

# ___ Cr 1.6 (as of ___, on admision 2.0, after IVF 
Cr 1.4,likely was pre-renal ___ hypovolemia from poor PO intake. 
His lisinopril was initially held and then restarted when Cr 
returned to baseline. 

#Pancytopenia: Has had low WBC, Ht and plat on and off since 
___ likely from his hep C meds, ribaviron and interferon. Low 
plat can also be explained by hep C cirrhosis. However it 
appears that he may have been pancyopenic (to a lesser extent) 
even before starting Hep C treatment. Most etiologies have been 
ruled out, but a retic count, smear, copper level, zinc level, 
SPEP/UPEP, and consideration of repeat abd u/s to eval for 
splenomegaly would be helpful as an outpatient.  Of course, a 
bone marrow biopsy would be beneficial if all of these are 
negative.

#Nocturia: He reported nocturia with a normal UA - most likely 
suggesting BPH. PCP notified and ___ discuss potential 
treatment, though caution in patients with dizziness as this can 
exacerbate it.

and held ACE-i initially with ___ but was restarted when Cr back 
to baseline. 
 
# HLD: Continued simvastatin

#Health Maintenance: Pt was started on ASA 81 daily because of 
his age and risk factors for cardiovascular disease.  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

copper level, zinc level, SPEP/UPEP, and consideration of repeat 
abd u/s to eval for splenomegaly would be helpful as an 
outpatient.  Of course, a bone marrow biopsy would be beneficial 
if all of these are negative.
#H pylori - f.u antibodies
#consider repeat colonoscopy if constipation persists or if this 
represents a change in his bowel habits

Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with a PMH of schizophrenia 
and multiple prior psych hospitalizations including 2 months 
recently at ___ and is a ___ pt, who was brought in by police 
for erratic behavior and disorganization. Initially during 
admission, the patient had persistent difficulty answering 
questions due to disorganized speech and tangential thought 
process. Collateral from OP treater and prior records indicated 
this is a typical presentation for her, as she is generally 
non-compliant with her outpatient medical and therapy regimen, 
and efforts to obtain guardianship have been unsuccessful to 
date (so far, court appointed guardians have refused to serve). 
On admission, she met ___ criteria due to inability to 
care for self as demonstrated by medication and OP treatment 
non-compliance, and presenting by police escort due to her 
behavior.  Her pharmacy was contacted who confirmed that she 
last picked up medications on ___ (Risperidone 4mg BID) and has 
not filled any prescriptions since that time. She refused to 
sign a CV so remained under a ___ designation for 
disorganized thoughts and behavior and inability to care for 
herself. She refused all medications including antipsychotics 
and diabetes medications. A ___ form was submitted on ___ 
and the trial was held on ___ at which time it was determined 
that she met criteria for involuntary treatment under 7,8,8B 
commitment. Treatment was initiated with risperidone 2 mg BID 
(with Haldol 5 mg IM BID if she refused risperidone, to be given 
with Benadryl). She did not have improvement with uptitration of 
risperidone, so was switched to Invega Sustenna IM injection. 
She was also started on insulin and glipizide for treatment of 
diabetes (FSBG in the 200s consistently). After Invega 
(Paliperidone) IM and Paliperidone PO, her symptoms improved 
significantly over the course of hospitalization, though her 
thought process remained at times tangential with paranoid 
content which is likely due to chronic schizophrenia and is 
unliklely to further improve with continued inpatient 
hospitalization. On the day of discharge, she was able to have a 
well-organized conversation with the team.  She was discharged 
to her home apartment which was confirmed to be held for her.  
She initially refused visiting nursing services but today 
accepted them as well as an appointment with ___ her CBSW 
(set up for 10am ___.  She is agreeable to seeing Dr.

- after the hearing, she was treated with risperidone 2 mg BID 
(with Haldol 5 mg IM BID if she refused risperidone, to be given 
with Benadryl). Risperidone was uptitrated to 3 mg qAM and 4 mg 
qPM without any improvement in symptoms, so she was switched to 
the Invega Sustenna IM injection. Invega Sustenna 234 mg IM 
injection on ___, 156 mg IM injection on ___, followed 
by 117 mg IM injection monthly
(first dose on ___.
- started Invega PO 3 mg daily (will titrate up to 6 mg daily, 
further titration based on patient's symptoms) while on 
inpatient unit.  Due to likelihood on non-compliance patient 
will not be sent out on it.  
- patient refused Depakote, so this medication was not restarted
***** Please start patient in ___

#agitation - intermittent during admission. Patient refused 
Ativan at night, but agitation improved on Invega Sustenna. By 
the end of hospitalization patient was not having issues with 
agitation and was found to be very pleasant and socializing with 
peers in the dayroom.   

Medical:
#diabetes 
- prior to the court order, she refused all medications
- after the hearing, she was treated with insulin glargine 15u 
daily (increased to 20u daily) with SSI
- she was also treated with glipizide 10 mg BID using the 5 mg 
pill size (refused higher dose of glipizide because larger pill 
resembled metformin, which she refused because metformin gives 
her diarrhea)
- Due to likelihood of noncompliance, history of erratic eating 
behaviors, and that the patient has not been dangerously 
hyperglycemic we will discharge on glyburide 10 mg BID as this 
is the highest likelihood of compliance.

members can contact outpatient providers since patient is here 
under court commitment, in order to facilitate patient care

- Psychiatrist: Dr. ___ ___

  Case Mgr/Community Resource Specialist: ___ *********
- As part of our assessment, collateral was obtained from 
multiple sources including Dr. ___ psychiatrist, 
___ who runs her housing, etc to guide her care.  
- Dr. ___ patient on ___ aware is patient is 
being discharged and emphasizes needs for services. 

INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting this medication, and risks and benefits of possible 
alternatives, including not taking the medication, with this 
patient.   We discussed the patient's right to decide whether to 
take this medication as well as the importance of the patient's 
actively participating in the treatment and discussing any  
questions about medications with the treatment team, and I  
answered the patient's questions.  The patient appeared able to 
understand and consented to begin the medication.

RISK ASSESSMENT
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of inability to care for self based on her level 
of behavioral and cognitive disorganization and treatment 
noncompliance.  Her static factors noted at that time include 
history of chronic mental illness, history of childhood abuse, 
single status, and ___ medical problems (diabetes). The 
primary modifiable risk factor addressed during hospitalization 
included active psychosis with profound disorganization. Since 
court commitment, pt has been started on medications to treat 
her psychosis and diabetes, and has demonstrated improvement. 
She has gained some insight (but not ideal) into her mental and 
physical illness and the need for consistent treatment. 
Collaboration with outpatient team will help to ensure that 
patient's progress is maintained once she is discharged to 
community. Finally, pt does have protective factors, including 
___ services and engagement with outpatient provider ___ 
as well as a good relationship with apartment building manager 
and staff. She is now open to seeing ___ (Case 
Worker), and asking about a therapist named ___.  
Outpatient providers Dr. ___ are 
actively involved in her care. 

Overall, based on the totality of our assessment at this time, 
the patient is chronically at a moderate risk of having limited 
insight/judgment and impaired self-care but is now sufficiently 
caring for herself (eating, drinking, sleeping, adherent with 
medications on unit) and does not appear to be at acute risk of 
harm to self/others.

Our Prognosis of this patient is poor given the severity of 
chronic mental illness and level of functional impairment, 
limited response to medications, difficulty with consistent 
compliance/follow up, and repeated hospitalizations.  She will 
need continued follow up as her outpatient providers are already 
aware of. Long-term placement in assisted living facility is a 
likely possibility.

SUMMARY:
========
___ with EtOH use disorder, s/p gastric sleeve ___, revised
___, CKD4 (IgA nephropathy) admitted to MICU ___ with 
sepsis,
loculated empyema ___ gastropleural fistula s/p thoracics chest
tube and broad abx (vanc/cefe/metronidazole/fluc).S/p failed
cauterization of fistulous tract (GI). Bariatric surgery,
thoracics, ACS, GI consulting; RYGB thought to be indicated, but
pt not candidate given malnutrition. On the floor, felt to have
recrudescence of infectious symptoms, with
fluid-responsivehypotension, delirium. ___, recurrent fever,
enlarging R pleural effusion s/p IP pigtail (transudate),
persistent L sided effusion. Abx ___.  Now 
transferred
to MICU ___ with progressive oliguric renal failure, worsening
hypoxemia. Family meeting ___ delineating no escalation, no
RRT. Following day converted to CMO. Patient expired on ___ 
at 3:05 AM.

ACUTE ISSUES:
============
#Acute Hypoxemic/Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure
Patient developed increasing hypoxemia during his floor course, 
likely multifactorial iso volume overload ___ renal failure and 
HFpEF exacerbation, edema ___ sepsis and hypoalbuminemia, 
further c/b hospital acquired PNA. Required
increasing oxygen on floor, 6L NC iso increasing pulmonary edema 
on CXR. Mild hypercarbia may be ___ hypoventilation from 
splinting d/t pain from chest tube; and/or contribution from 
opiates. He was initially trialed on NIPPV which did not show 
any significant change ___ his VBGs. Diuresis was continued with 
increasing dose of Lasix gtt and diuril was added, with no 
response, and continued anuria. Patient was converted to DNR/DNI 
and ultimately CMO, passing away on ___ AHRF and septic 
shock as below. 

#Complicated Empyema ___ to Gastro-pleural Fistula
#Septic Shock
#Leukocytosis
Patient presented with septic shock secondary to complicated 
L-sided empyema, initially requiring Levophed for pressor 
support. Pleural fluid studies were consistent with a 
complicated empyema resulting from direct communication with the 
GI tract, likely secondary to gastric sleeve complications from 
alcohol abuse. He was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics 
(Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl/Micafungin).  On the recommendation of the 
ID team, micafungin was ultimately switched to fluconazole.  
Bariatric surgery, thoracic surgery, and advanced endoscopy 
teams were consulted. He went for an EGD on ___. Since he was 
hemodynamically stable off-pressors, he was transferred to the 
floor afterward. He remained febrile despite
___ likely d/t lack of adequate source 
control. CT ___ with additional left sided consolidations c/f 
___ acquired PNA as well. Floor course had been centered 
around planning a potential operative/procedural plan for 
definitive correction of the fistula. So far endoscopic internal 
drainage
via double-pigtail stents on ___ unsuccessful and [patient felt 
to be poor candidate for bariatric surgery. Patient ultimately 
made DNR/DNI, transitioned to CMO, and succumbed to septic shock 
and respiratory failure, expiring on ___. 

___ on CKD
#CKD, stage 4
#IgA nephropathy
#Metabolic acidosis
Patient had a baseline Cr 2.2-2.6, with CKD secondary to IgA 
nephropathy. He presented with Cr of 4.2, which was likely 
pre-renal ___ the setting of septic shock; renal function rapidly 
returned to normal after IV fluid resuscitation.  He was given 
IVF and IV bicarb supplementation ___ order to normalize his 
non-AG metabolic acidosis and increase his bicarb level. He was 
followed by nephrology. Given that he was NPO, we held his home 
bicarb supplements, and he intermittently required bicarb gtt, 
his acidosis improved with resolution of his ___. Unfortunately 
floor course was c/b progressive renal failure iso persistent 
shock, leading to significant volume overload and increasing 
oxygen requirement. This was refractory to Lasix gtt diuresis. 
Per wife, ___ not within GOC. 

#Acute on Chronic Anemia
#Hematuria
He presented with Hgb of ~7, with studies consistent with anemia 
from chronic
disease, likely ___ the setting of CKD. He previously reported 
hematuria. His CBC was monitored, which remained stable, and he 
had no overt signs of bleeding. He received multiple, 
intermittent pRBC transfusions over the course of his 
hospitalization, and his CBC was trended daily. Guaiacs have 
been negative. Baseline anemia
likely ___ CKD which is worsening. Hx of folate/B12 deficiency 
as
well. Has intermittently required transfusions since admission
for HgB <7.0 with otherwise unclear etiology. Hemolysis work up
has been negative as noted, and no overt signs of bleeding on 
any
imaging/exam. 

# NSTEMI
# HFpEF Exacerbation
Patient reported to have h/o diastolic dysfunction, LVEF remains
>60% on most recent TTE. BNP has continued to rise during
hospital course with CXR showing increasing pulmonary edema.
Although being driven by multiple factors, acute on chronic
diastolic function is likely certain to be one of them. Etiology
of HFpEF exacerbation most likely iso sepsis, worsening renal 
failure. Trop elevation >0.3, EKG with non-specific T wave 
changes, felt to be most likely stress/demand induced. 

#Acute on chronic pain
Per chart review, he has been taking 10mg q6h of oxycodone, 
filling 120 pills per month consistently since ___. 
Palliative care was involved, and he was placed him on a 
dilaudid PCA for pain control which was subsequently 
discontinued d/t difficulties reaching the PCA for self 
administration. His dilaudid was increased instead.  

#Afib
Given his septic shock and concern for GIB and upcoming 
procedures, we held his metoprolol succinate and Eliquis.  He 
was adequately rate controlled off metoprolol.

#Alcohol use disorder
Hx of alcohol abuse with intermittent binge drinking. Last drink
1.5 weeks prior to admission. Patient states he drinks 
approximately 4 vodka cocktails a day.
Did not appear to have signs of withdrawal at OSH. We consulted 
social work and treated him daily folate, thiamine, MVI.

#Thrombocytosis
Likely ___ the setting of acute infection. We monitored his CBC 
daily.

#Nutrition
Patient was unable to take p.o. due to his gastropleural 
fistula; as a result, nutrition was consulted, and he was 
started on TPN per their recommendations.

Mr. ___ is a ___ yo M w/ h/o chronic pancreatitis ___ past 
ETOH use, Hepatitis C without significant cirrhosis, and HTN who 
p/w flank pain.  
.  
# Flank pain- The pt's workup included a u/a without any 
abnormalities and and urine cx which showed no growth. ___ which 
he had on admission does not generally cause pain. CT abd in the 
ED did not show a source of pain. Pt did not have pain when abd 
was examined with a stethoscope with pressure. Given pain on 
palpation of paravertebral muscles, a musculoskeletal cause of 
pain was considered most likely but constipation could have been 
contributing as well. Given pt's h/o addiction to ETOH in past, 
admission to active cocaine use several mo ago and purchasing 
narcotics off street within last wk, there were questions of 
narcotic seeking on the part of the pt and reluctance on the 
part of the providers in prescribing narcotics. His urine tested 
+ for opiates on admission. The ___ pharmacy in ___ 
which the pt stated he got all his prescriptions from was unable 
to confirm his h/o recieving regular narcotics prescriptions 
from his PCP ___ 1 mo PTA.  In fact, they were only able to 
confirm filling the 6 tabs of oxycodone which the pt admitted to 
getting from ___ on the day PTA and the pt stated he 
had used up on the day of admission.  Records in ___ showed that 
he got 30mg TID from Dr. ___ 6+ mo from ___. It is 
unclear why this was stopped but the pt states when he was 
referred to the pancreatic surgeons and opted against surgery, 
he did not return to Dr. ___.  The pt was started in 
house on lidocaine patch, tizanidine and an aggressive bowel 
regimen including docusate, senna, miralax, milk of magnesia and 
lactulose.  He did not have a BM prior to d/c but was given a Rx 
for lactulose at discharge.  He was started on clear liquids on 
the night of admission which was advanced to regular diet prior 
to discharge with pt tolerating POs without increase of his 
pain.   On discharge, he was given a Rx for tizanidine and 
oxycodone 15mg tab #16 for pain control and instructions to f/u 
with his PCP.  
.
# ARF- possibly from CT contrast at OSH. He did recieve another 
CT with IV contrast in our ED. Cr. on admission 1.6 from last 
baseline ___ yrs ago of 0.9.  Pt was given 2l IVF in the ED and 
another 2L overnight.  Of note, constant urination overnight 
increased his flank pain with 1 dose of IV toradol given for 
pain.  On the day of d/c, his Cr had fallen to 1.1.
.  
# Chronic pancreatitis- Pt stated this admission that his 
pancreatitis pain was stable.  From his pharmacy, it did not 
appear that he was regularly filling his creon. Lipase not 
elevated here which is not particularly helpful given h/o 
chronic pancreatitis. CT w/o evidence of acute pancreatitis and 
rather with stable changes although f/u MRCP was recommended. 
Via e-mail, Dr. ___ agreed to f/u with pt regarding 
his chronic pancreatitis and a voicemail was left for him with 
information for him to make a f/u appt in Dr. ___.  
Creon was continued in house and prescribed on d/c.  
.  
# Depression- pt refusing to talk to a social worker or 
psychiatrist at this time. He did describe passive SI on 
admission but denied any active SI or plan. He was instructed in 
his d/c paperwork to talk to his PCP about his depression and 
call ___ or go to the nearest ED should he have suicidal 
thoughts.

SUMMARY STATEMENT:
==================

Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with PMH of DLBCL 
(diagnosed at ___ ___ with CNS involvement and chronic 
microhemmorhages, depression/anxiety, directly admitted from 
clinic due to orthostatic hypotension in setting of C diff 
diarrhea. She was given a 10d PO vanc course with resolution of 
symptoms. She was additionally administered hyperCVAD part 3B, 
delayed by 2 days due to symptoms. She was discharged on 
filgrastim daily. 

====================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================

[ ] Given history of chronic CNS microhemorrhages, we recommend 
nonemergent outpatient neurosurgery follow-up, to establish 
minimum threshold for platelet counts, necessity of future subcu 
heparin use, and decisions regarding interval monitoring of 
known right frontal lobe stable hemorrhage.

[ ] Patient may benefit from outpatient neurocognitive 
evaluation given CNS disease burden.

[ ] She was unable to get her scheduled port placement during 
this admission due to her symptoms. This will need to be 
coordinated for her next cycle.

2. Medical: History of HTN for which we continued home 
Amlodipine and ASA. Amlodipine was given in the morning with sip 
of water on days of ECT to prevent elevated BPs with good 
response.
 
3. Psychiatric
He was sent to the ED by Dr. ___ consideration of ECT in 
the setting of worsening depression, neurovegetative sx x6 days, 
and SI with thoughts of buying a gun x2 weeks. Per Dr. ___ 
___ the patient called to make an urgent appointment. He 
reported that while at a cousin's house in ___, they 
talked about gun shows, which made him think about buying a gun, 
putting it into his mouth and ending his life. He spent six days 
in bed, slept 15 hours a day, lost 10 lbs, and had alcohol 
cravings (sober for more than a year). In the ED, the patient 
endorsed ongoing thoughts of suicide, hopelessness, 
helplessness, and hypersomnia. He denied having aggressive 
impulses or HI, episodes of paranoia or hallucinations. Denies 
any use of illicit substances, but smokes a pack a day.

On admission the continued to endorse SI, remained in bed 
throughout the day, had poor grooming, and did not shower daily. 
Initially, he did not attend groups or participate in the 
milieu. He was isolated and uninterested in activities he used 
to find pleasurable including reading. He described poor sleep 
with multiple night time awakenings and no concrete plan on how 
to address financial issues. On ___ patient informed staff 
that he was having increasing suicidal thoughts with thoughts of 
hanging himself with his belt, which he then gave to staff. He 
described suicidal thoughts as ""intrusive and uncomfortable,"" 
which motivated him to continue with treatment for his mood. His 
home psychiatric medications, including effexor 375mg daily, 
lithium 450mg qhs, propranolol 20mg bid prn anxiety, vistaril 
35mg bid prn anxiety were continued. Home ritalin was continued 
due to prior history of ADHD without issues. Home topiramate was 
discontinued given plans for ECT. He was seen and cleared by ECT 
consult team, medicine, and anaesthesia. He started unilateral 
ECT on ___, received 4 unilateral treatments and 2 bilateral 
treatments for a total of 6 treatments. The patient had 
significant improvement in his mood symptoms and affect. Overall 
the patient tolerated ECT well; however had some physical 
complaints including: nausea, neck/back pain, and headache. 
These symptoms were treated with Tordol IV, tylenol, and zofran 
IV after ECT sessions. The patient also mentioned having some 
confusion following ECT but within an hour he was oriented x3 
without signs of lasting memory impairment. Baseline MOCA on 
___ was ___. MOCA at time of discharge was ___. His 
visuospatial/executive fuction significantly improved from ___ 
to ___ but continued to have significant deficiencies in delayed 
recall with ___ words at baseline and ___ words at discharge.

Patient's mood gradually improved over the first four courses of 
unilateral ECT with significant improvement following switch to 
bilateral ECT. Patient reported attending to ADLs including 
daily showering and dressing, had increased energy, improved 
appetite, and improved concentration and ability to experience 
pleasure (able to read and enjoy various books). His mood 
improved from ___ the first week to ___ the second week to 
___ at discharge. His speech went from slow with multiple 
pauses to spontaneous with normal rate, rhythm and prosidy at 
discharge. He also displayed full range of affect and reactivity 
at discharge with increased in future thinking with concrete 
plans of looking for a job and getting together with friends 
from ___. He was able to vocalize an understanding of the 
severity of his condition at admission and expressed he would 
seek help by calling psychiatrist or going to the ED if he 
noticed decrease in mood, energy, appetite, hopelessness, or 
SI/HI.  

4. Substance Abuse: No acute issues
In terms of alcohol dependance he has been sober for 15months 
and regularly attends AA meetings. He was continued on 
naltrexone 50mg po daily. Topiramate was held for ECT and will 
not be restarted on discharge due to ongoing outpatient ECT. 
Discussion was held with patient about stopping Topiramate which 
he was in agreement with and reported no cravings during 
hospitalization. He understands that if he experiences increased 
cravings after discharge he can discuss additional treatment 
with outpatient psychiatrist. Nicotine patch 21mg daily was 
given due to active smoking history without issues.

5. Social/Milieu:
Pt  was encouraged to participate in units 
groups/milieu/therapy opportunities.  Usage of coping skills and 
mindfulness/relaxation methods were encouraged. Early on patient 
spent majority of time in bed, was not motivated to get out of 
bed. He gradually became less isolated and more visible on 
mileu, more interactive with peers. He attended group sessions 
throughout his time in the unit including coping skills, AA, 
meditation, and projects group.  
 
6. Risk Assessment: 
Acute risk is low.

Patient risk factors for harming self include a history of 
dysthymia and major depressive disorder with a history of 
alcohol dependence currently sober for 15months, financial 
hardships with recent job loss, and percieved poor family 
support. His protective factors include good insight and

treatment including psychiatrist, therapist and ECT treatments. 
He is future oriented with concrete plans to find a job and 
reconnect with friends and family. He is therefore not at any 
significant elevated acute risk at this time to warrant 
inpatient hospitalization and is aware that if thoughts of 
harming self, isolation, decreased appetite or changes in mood 
return he will contact psychiatrist and call ___ to come be 
evaluated by ED.
 
7. Disposition: Patient to return home this evening; will be

OPERATIVE REPORT
================
Surgeon:  ___, ___

ASSISTANT:  ___.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Left lower extremity claudication.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Left lower extremity claudication.

INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  This is a ___ female with
a history of lumbosacral radiculopathy as well as peripheral
arterial disease who previously underwent bilateral common
iliac artery stenting and left SFA stenting at an outside
institution.  She was told by an outside vascular surgeon at
___ that she had failure of her left SFA stent and,
therefore, came to Dr. ___ a second opinion.  She
then underwent angiogram which showed patent infrarenal
abdominal aorta as well as bilateral common iliac artery
stents.  She also had patent left common femoral artery and
profunda but occlusion of the left SFA shortly after its
takeoff with reconstitution of the above knee popliteal
artery via collaterals.  The previously placed left SFA stent
was occluded.  Regarding her runoff, the anterior tibial and
peroneal artery were patent within the leg.  The posterior
tibial artery occluded shortly after its takeoff and was not
visualized in the lower leg.  The anterior tibial artery
provided the predominant flow to the foot via patent dorsalis
pedis artery.  Given these findings, the decision was made to
schedule her for common femoral to above knee bypass with
PTFE graft.

PROCEDURES:  Left common femoral to above knee popliteal
bypass graft with PTFE.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was consented for the
proposed operation.  The risks and benefits of this procedure
were discussed with her.  She was then brought back to the
operating room and upon entrance into the room, a timeout was
held to confirm proper patient, side, site and procedure.
She was then positioned supine on the operating table and
general anesthesia was induced.  Preoperative antibiotics
were administered.  The leg and groin were then prepped and
draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A timeout was again
held to confirm the patient's identity, site and side of
surgery.

We began by making a longitudinal incision in the left groin
over the common femoral artery where we felt a pulse.  We
dissected down to the artery which seemed quite stuck to the
surrounding tissues.  We were then able to isolate this and
gain proximal and distal control using vessel loops.  During
the dissection, the saphenous vein was encountered and a
small tear was made in the side of the vessel.  This was
repaired using a figure of eight Prolene suture.  Similarly,
we made approximately a 12 cm longitudinal incision over the
medial aspect of the thigh along the anticipated border of
the sartorius muscle.  The skin incision was deepened through
the subcutaneous tissue exposing the adductor tendon
anteriorly and the sartorius muscle posteriorly.  The fascia
between these 2 muscles was incised and the popliteal fossa
was entered.  We identified the popliteal artery which felt
quite firm.  A self-retaining retractor was placed deeper in
the wound and the popliteal artery was palpated and exposed.
We then gave 6000 units of heparin and an ACT was checked
which was 249.

We made an incision over the region where we had hoped to
create our distal anastomosis in the popliteal artery;
however, upon entering the lumen of the artery, it is noted
that there was a stent there.  The stent was removed and
distally there appeared to be some neointimal hyperplasia.
We opened the lumen using ___ catheter and dilators
which resulted in effective back bleeding.  We then extended
our arteriotomy distally and closed the proximal aspect of
the arteriotomy using Prolene suture.  Now that we had both
our proximal and distal targets dissected out, we made our
tunnel and passed an umbilical tape through this space so
that the PTFE graft could later be introduced.  After
retention sutures were placed on either side of the above
knee popliteal artery, we then fashioned our anastomosis
using the heel to toe parachute technique and PTFE graft with
___ Gore suture.  Once this was complete, we removed our
vessel loops and good hemostasis was noted.  We then
delivered our PTFE graft through our previously made tunnel
superiorly up towards the common femoral artery.  We incised
the end of the PTFE graft and cut it so that it would rest
flushly on the artery.  Again, in heel to toe parachute
fashion, we created our anastomosis to the common femoral
artery using ___ Gore suture and completed our anastomosis in
standard fashion.  The vessel loops were then released.  Good
hemostasis was noted and flow through the graft and distally
was confirmed using a Doppler.

We closed our incisions in multiple layers using Vicryl
suture and the skin was reapproximated with staples.  The
patient had a strong Doppler signal at the end of the case
and the foot was warm.  Overall the patient tolerated the
procedure well.  There were no intraoperative complications.

Dr. ___ was present throughout the entire operation in
compliance with CMS regulations.

Dilaudid PCA for pain control. When tolerating oral intake, the 
patient was transitioned to oral pain medications.
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
Pulmonary: Postoperatively the patient had low urine output, she 
was given fluid boluses until urine output improved. On POD # 4, 
the patient desaturated and was required supplemental O2. Chest 
xray revealed bilateral pulmonary effusion and pulmonary edema. 
The patient was given one dose of Lasix, nebulizers and was 
encouraged to ambulate. The respiratory status improved, the 
patient was off O2 on POD # 6. The patient remained stable from 
a pulmonary standpoint. 
GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO/NGT with 
IV fluids. NGT was removed on POD # 3. Diet was advanced when 
appropriate, which was well tolerated.  Patient's intake and 
output were closely monitored, and IV fluid was adjusted when 
necessary.  Electrolytes were routinely followed, and repleted 
when necessary.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were 
closely watched for signs of infection. Wound was monitored 
routinely, wicks were removed on POD # 3. The staples will 
remain until her follow up appointment.
Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout 
his stay; no insulin administration was required.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined 
routinely; no transfusions were required.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and 
venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.

___ year old female with a history of HIV (VL undetectable, CD4 
517 on ___, difficult to control hypertension with 
complications of ESRD on HD presenting with nausea and vomiting, 
found to have hypertensive urgency.  
   
# Hypertensive urgency. Etiology unclear, though the patient has 
a long history of difficult to control hypertension.  Her nausea 
and vomiting prevented her from ingesting her evening 
medications.  There also appeared to be a component of 
panic/anxiety as the patient's blood pressure waxed and waned 
with reported stressful feelings.  She denied substance abuse 
and there was no evidence for that on serum and urine tox 
screen.  She arrived on the floor on a nitro drip that was 
quickly weaned as her blood pressure came under control.  She 
was restarted on her home lisinopril and labetalol and 
amlodipine was also started.  She was ruled out for an MI. 
   
# Nausea, vomiting. Unclear if this precipitated the 
hypertension (due to wretching and inability to keep medications 
down) or if this was a complication of hypertension. It 
disappeared after receiving anti-emetics and with better blood 
pressure control.  The patient had no nausea and was tolerating 
POs without difficulty on the day of discharge.
   
# Troponin elevation. The patient had a troponin elevation of 
0.9, however, this is consistent with her prior measurements and 
is likely chronically elevated due to ESRD.  A repeat troponin 
was similar.
  
# HIV (VL undetectable on ___, CD4 517 on ___. Stable 
and well-controlled.  She was continued on her home regimen of 
atazanavir, lamivudine, tenofovir and ritonavir.  Her 
valacyclovir was also continued.  
 
# ESRD on HD. The patient received HD on the morning of 
discharge.  Her lanthanum and vitamin supplementation was 
continued.  
 
# Depression. Home dose of luoxetine and clonazepam continued. 
 
# Right sided SVC-like syndrome due to central stenosis. S/p 
multiple invasive procedures:  The patient was continued on 
aspirin.  
.  
# Asthma. Stable without signs of exacerbation currently.  Home 
doses of albuterol, fluticase, and salmeterol continued.  
.  
# Invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast s/p modified 
radical mastectomy ___.  Arimidex was continued.  
   
# Anemia, Hct ___ at baseline. Currently within that range. 
Likely anemia of chronic disease.  
   
# Left lower extremity trace edema. Per patient report this is a 
long-standing problem.  It did not worsen during this 
hospitalization.

" y/o F with PMHx of HTN, CHF, Atrial fibrillation, Bullous 
pemphigoid presenting with acute onset of right flank pain, 
admitted for workup of right sided ureteral obstruction seen on 
CTU A/P.

#Urinary tract obstruction: Moderate to severe right 
hydroureteronephrosis with normal appearance of the distal right 
ureter on CTU A/P. Concern for mass effect or radio-opaque stone 
as CT was negative for obstructing calculi. Pyelonephritis less 
likely given hemodynamic and clinical stability and negative UA, 
however there is a mild leukocytosis and exam initially 
significant for right CVA tenderness. No hematuria or difficulty 
urinating. Urology did not feel that cystoscopy was indicated as 
she no longer endorsed right flank pain, did not have an 
infection, and her Creatinine had returned to baseline (1.0) 
overnight after receiving maintenance fluids. KUB did not reveal 
radio-opaque stone. She will follow-up with urology in clinic to 
determine the need for additional imaging.
 
#Acute kidney injury: Creatinine 1.5 on admission from 1.2 in 
___. Patient received maintenance IVF overnight with 
Creatinine to 1.0 on discharge.

#Hypertension: SBPs 160-170 on arrival, likely exacerbated by 
acute unilateral ureteral obstruction. Patient remained 
asymptomatic and was restarted on her home anti-hypertensive 
medications: Lisinopril and Amlodipine 

#Bullous Pemphigoid: Continue with Methotrexate for 3 doses 
every 12 hours on ___ and Prednisone taper (currently at 10 
mg daily) with plans to talk to her PCP about additional taper.

#?Complex cystic structure: Seen on RUQ US between the IVC and 
right portal vein measuring up to 4.6 cm, which has increased in 
size since ___, and may represent a complex hepatic cyst or 
cystic biliary neoplasm such as a cystadenoma. Given that the 
patient was asymptomatic, she should consider additional imaging 
(CT with contrast) after discharge.
