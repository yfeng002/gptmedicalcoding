{"context": "To accurately classify clinical text into the correct category, consider the following holistic context guidelines:\n1) **Keyword Identification**: Begin by identifying specific keywords and phrases that are indicative of each category. However, recognize that keywords alone may not be sufficient for accurate classification.\n2) **Contextual Analysis**: Evaluate the broader context in which keywords appear. Consider the surrounding text to determine the primary focus and intent. For example, the mention of 'surgery' could relate to 'Therapy or Surgery', but if the context is about the patient's ability to consent, it may relate to 'Consent'.\n3) **Category Overlaps**: Be aware of potential overlaps between categories. For instance, 'Non-Neoplasm Disease Stage' and 'Organ or Tissue Status' may both discuss disease progression, but the former focuses on non-cancerous conditions while the latter emphasizes organ functionality.\n4) **Exclusion Criteria**: Identify exclusion criteria for each category. For example, 'Neoplasm Status' should exclude non-cancerous conditions, which belong to 'Non-Neoplasm Disease Stage'.\n5) **Specificity and Detail**: Consider the specificity and detail of the text. Detailed descriptions of medical tests may indicate 'Laboratory Examinations', while general mentions of health conditions may relate to 'Disease'.\n6) **Temporal and Conditional Indicators**: Pay attention to temporal references and conditional statements that may influence classification. For example, 'recently diagnosed' may suggest 'Diagnostic', while 'long-term management' may indicate 'Therapy or Surgery'.\n7) **Patient-Centric Focus**: Determine if the text is patient-centric, focusing on individual characteristics like 'Age', 'Gender', or 'Special Patient Characteristic', versus broader clinical or research contexts.\n8) **Clinical vs. Research Context**: Distinguish between clinical and research contexts. Texts discussing study participation may relate to 'Enrollment in other studies', while those focusing on patient care may belong to 'Nursing' or 'Therapy or Surgery'.\n9) **Holistic Understanding**: Develop a holistic understanding of the text by integrating multiple elements, such as symptoms, treatments, and patient characteristics, to accurately determine the primary category.\n10) **Iterative Review**: Continuously review and refine classification decisions, considering new information or changes in context that may affect categorization. By applying these guidelines, you can improve the accuracy and consistency of clinical text classification within the given taxonomy system.",
